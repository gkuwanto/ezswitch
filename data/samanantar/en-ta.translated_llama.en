The nuclear waste of the Croats is the obstacle for the Bosniaks
The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are opposed to the storage of a portion of the radioactive waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region, which is located near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and is known for its natural beauty and the river, have protested against it. 
The Bosnian Croat parliamentarians, who are staying in the old military barracks in Tkošćak, have decided to abandon the plan to store ammunition in Gorazde, and have vowed to fight against that plan. 
The waste products of the nuclear reactor are stored there. 
The Bosnians who came with the aid packages, which included tents and blankets, said that the nuclear waste stored in the Una River, which 250,000 people living in that area are exposed to, poses a danger to them. 
We must say "we want"! 
The mayor of the city of Novi Grad, Miroslav Dereljaka, said this at the meeting. 
We must struggle to protect our way of life and our self-respect 
The factory located in Slovenia in the 1980s belongs to Croatia.
Two countries' high-ranking officials will meet to discuss the issue of additional storage facilities and waste disposal next week. 
According to Russia's national TV channel Rossiya-1, it has not been decided yet whether the country will maintain its own savings or invest in the construction of a new savings bank in Slovenia. 
The head of the environmental and energy department of Croatia, Tomislav, said that the waste generated from schools, hospitals and prisons should be removed, and that there is a problem with Croatia's environmental protection, and that he is trying to find a solution. 
The action-takers, officials, and residents from all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including those near the nuclear plant, urged Croatia to make a decision 
Diereljaga asked why Togoska Gora, a part of Bosnia, was chosen. 
The authorities will not be able to degrade us 
Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has accused the Uttar Pradesh government of only being concerned with publicity and not with the welfare of farmers. 
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the general secretary of the Indian National Congress, is criticizing the daily actions of various BJP governments through social media platforms every day. 
In this state, yesterday, the Uttar Pradesh government did not take care of the farmers' welfare. 
The Uttar Pradesh BJP government's atrocities against farmers are only limited to billboards and pamphlets.
The cultivators have not received even the value of their land from the government until now. 
The farmers are not being provided with proper irrigation. 
However, their fine is increased to a severe extent.
They are being deceived under the name of 'forgiveness' 
The one who said this was being told by the higher authorities of the state that they will be punished. 
What is the Polish version of "Mensch" in Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which comes in the next issue of Netfliks? 
The parents who take care of the child in this state, whether their child is healthy or not, will treat them as if they are sick. 
The Polish is coming to the Netflicks today. 
This is the story of Donald Trump, the President of America, who wants to tell – but he wants to be the headmaster of his own school. 
The American Horror Story and Glee actors Ryan Murphy, Ben Platt, and Lucy Boynton are coming up in this.
This event, which does not speak much about itself, is a story that has a note of Proximus, the son of Manesha, who is a person who takes care of himself when he is in good health, but when he has a physical or mental defect, he acts like he is acting in a state of play.
That person is as if they have no physical body, they will make a mess in this state, which has many kinds. 
Although, in particular, Mansha's behavior is a person who is careful about what he eats, it is as if he is eating poison. 
This is a lack of care or attention, or a disturbance or injury, and it is classified as child abuse. 
This is a rather poetic and philosophical passage. Here is my attempt at a translation:
What are the signs of the presence of a madman? 
The signs of the present state may vary from person to person, but according to the Higher Self, it is necessary to be aware of the subsequent state with awareness. 
Even if their child is healthy, they are making the doctors wait 
The excessive emphasis on signs or lying 
The conclusion that a child is not healthy is changed to the example of giving sugar to the urine samples of those who have diabetes, as an illustration.
The symptoms of illness shall be provoked, and as an example, they shall be given unnecessary medicines or other things that are not needed. 
Can a man of great wisdom be able to see the hidden meaning of the Proverbs?
The difficulty lies in the fact that this state is not spoken about much outside, so it is hard to know how much it has spread. 
In a study published in 2000, it was found that out of a sample of 100,000 people, 89 individuals had this symptom within a two-year period. 
If you think a child is in danger, what would you do

The police accused the children of being in a state of humanity-less environment; the accusation was refuted by the school. 
One who introduces himself as "I am the truth" and becomes a teacher in that school said that: "What they say is not true, because all the children are here only with the consent of their parents."
Before children are admitted to school, parents sign a form. 
The parents are used to bringing food for their children every day, and they know their situation. 
The police came to close the school before the children were taken out, and at the same time, the parents of the children brought by the police were also taken away, and we were shocked. 
This cannot be justified because the parents who are speaking to us as witnesses are the ones who put their children in a bad situation like the police say they do. 
The police inspector who was in charge before this, Abdul Rahman, told me that when he came to the school once, he did not see any complaints about how the children were being taken care of. 
The children did not learn anything except the Quran. 
But according to the officials of the police department, when the children are handed over to the state government after being taken away from their parents, they will be returned to their parents again, said Jacob Sappo. 
They are placed in a situation where they do not possess humanity, in the name of learning Quran.
Many of them have thorns on their backs, which are a sign of their downfall. 
He said, “We are investigating in the school to know who is the rightful owner of the school, because we want to know who is the rightful owner of the school, for that reason we are investigating in the school.”

The Rural Development Minister, P. Benjamin, presented a check for Rs. 5,000 to each of the pregnant women in the community development program, organized by the Villivakkam Panchayat Union in Tiruvallur district, under the Integrated Child Development Scheme of the Social Welfare and Nutrition Department. 
What the Minister of Finance, P. Benjamin, said in the meeting is as follows:
The government of the first Prime Minister, who is no more, has been functioning in the footsteps of Amma, and has been providing various welfare schemes to the simple people, and has been uplifting their livelihoods. 
The community protection plan for the underprivileged girls, which was set up in a special way by Amma's extraordinary plan, is being implemented in a special way for simple girls.
The fund for the assistance of women's childbearing has been increased from ₹12 lakhs to ₹18 lakhs. 
The benefits of children are divided into three stages: before birth, during birth, and after birth. 
The kingdom of Amma, which gives birth to children in hospitals, is giving away a gift box containing 16 types of items to the children born in hospitals. 
The government, under the leadership of the Chief Minister, is functioning in a commendable manner, as people are thinking of their well-being and are developing their living standards in a way that is beneficial to them. 
Today, the Tamil Nadu government has announced that 200 and more pregnant women who are associated with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) have been given a reward and a certificate of appreciation. 
The leaders led the way, and all of us followed with open eyes, with a promise of a brighter future. 
Later, the minister announced the decision to the public. 
In the final meeting for the community support for pregnant women, Minister Benjamin provided five types of food and meals for the pregnant women. 
One integrated child development project was implemented in 13 villages in Tiruvallur district as a part of the comprehensive coverage plan. 
The following 19 places: Ellapoor, Kummidippondi, Kadampathur, Meenjor, Pallipattu, Poovirundavalli, Poondi, R.K. Pet, Sovalur, Thiruvallankadu, Thiruvallur, Thiruttani, and Vilavakkam had 3,160 pregnant women participating in the community-based prenatal care program at 1760 anganwadi centers.
In this event, the Director of the Project (Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission) Mr. Jayakumar, the Coordinator of Integrated Child Development Scheme, Mrs. Rajarajeswari, and Government officials participated. 
The actor Kamal Haasan will be speaking about the use of social media by young people in relation to the digital age on October 1st, the second day, and about the digital age. 
Following the success, the challenges and complexities of film production, new storylines for new audiences, YouTube business model, and other topics are being discussed by many experienced individuals. 
In this, many people in the film and media industries have expressed their thoughts. 
In this event, which will take place from dawn to dusk on two consecutive days, those who wish to participate and meet new people are requested to register by contacting the organizer through the contact number below. 
If this much opposition is met with for the victory, then he will grow up as his father, the director S.A. Chandrasekhar, said. 
The song release function of the film 'Pikil' was held in Chennai recently. 
Vijay, who had taken part in the discussion, said, "Who would punish those who were responsible for the accident in which Subashree, who was killed in a road accident, lost her life, not knowing who was responsible, and the lorry driver is also punishing those who had caused the accident, and also saying, 'Where should we put someone, if we make them sit there, it will be good'". 
The ADMK government is facing severe criticisms for its speech on victory. 
At that time, the leader of the people, Kamal Haasan, has supported Vijay's speech. 
In this state, Vijay's father, S.A. Chandrasekhar, who is participating in an event in Nagarkoil, Kanyakumari district, today arrived at Tuticorin Airport from Chennai by flight. 
At that place, the critics who met him, asked him questions about the criticisms he had received. 
The reply to this was: When she was driving on the road in a car, she suddenly lost control and met with an accident, and Subashree died. 
Everyone is talking about this event. 
Everyone was speaking about one thing, which Victory spoke about. 
The court is still questioning why those who are related to the case of Sri Subha are not yet arrested. 
But those who are victorious in their thoughts, even the ministers and the ruling party, do not know why they oppose it. 
If there is opposition to the victory, then he is growing. 
If you speak, will this much opposition come, or not?
If one speaks of victory, then opposition comes, so he grows. 
The speakers, after watching the victory speech, asked the question whether he will enter politics. 
He said, "I don't know anything like that", S.A. Chandra Sekhar. 
We have asked them at the great assembly. 
The ones who speak say, "The one who is a devotee of the Lord is the one who is a beggar, who has fallen and is in a pitiful state, and that is a calamity, and there is no alternative to this." 
But, then, what was the reason that the victory celebration with music and dance, which was to be held immediately, was put off? 
The hero of the movie, who was acting, fell from above to below and died. 
The video was also released. 
But he should have said that he does not want to be responsible for his actions. 
A news has been spreading on WhatsApp for the past few days with the headline 'Warning to Dogs' 
If a dog bites something, even if its nail breaks, children should immediately inform their parents about it. 
The dog that bites along with the master will not tell it to the father of a small boy, and as a result, the rabies virus affected 90% of the small boy, and it was said that the video was also linked to it. 
The child who receives medical treatment and comes out is like a dog that barks, it's a scene in a video.
Did the people who are angry like a dog, which bites, walk like a dog, and did the spreading information on WhatsApp turn out to be true, we asked Dr. Ananthapadmanabhan, a veterinarian. 
The dog that has been bitten by the rabies virus will surely bite and infect those who have been bitten by the virus. 
But, the dog's nail grows into the body, causing rabies to spread.
In one place, a rabid dog's footprints were found, and if its tail is also found there, the disease can spread.
When a person with a wound or a sore is bitten by a rabid dog in the same place, the disease will spread. 
The reason why those who raise dogs in their homes put a collar with a warning bell on them is good. 
Because we need to give medical care to dogs, veterinarians also give them a shot once a year. 
The vitamin C in fresh lemons is present. 
The presence of potassium in the banana shall control the blood pressure and the heart beat. It has its own nature.
The following minerals are present in turmeric: Manganese, Potassium, Iron, Calcium, Lead, Copper, Magnesium, etc.
If one mixes turmeric with ghee and adds it to the juice of the Elumichchai plant, it will cure wounds, boils, ulcers, and joint pain. 
If you mix the large quantity of turmeric and the small quantity of saffron in water and boil it, the pain in the head will be cured. 
The opposing factors, which keep the bad thoughts under control, are the counter-arguments and the logical conclusions. 
The following chemical compounds, including niacin, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, and several other important chemical substances, are found in turmeric. 
If a nosebleed occurs, then by blowing yellow-colored smoke into the nose and inhaling the fumes, the nosebleed will be cured.
The beauty of a pearl is more than the ordinary yellow 
The possession of the ability to cure skin diseases. 
The following ailments shall be cured by using turmeric: 
Some girls among young girls have hair growing on their foreheads, just like boys.
If one applies vermilion to one's face, or if one wears a garland of flowers, or if one adorns oneself with ornaments, and then comes, one's hair will not grow. 
The beauty of the face shall be marred. 
The terrifying middle-aged seafront, the unknown child, the one who has been possessed by the spirit, has been ordered to appear in court 
The person who wore the clothes hidden by leaves, a 12-year-old boy in May 2017, was pulled backwards by someone from behind and taken into the bushes when he was on his way to school located at the central beach of the state. 
The person who did that to the child after hanging him on a tree, committed sexual abuse. 
After being arrested, within a short period of time, an order was issued to search the house, and the investigators took away many items related to the investigation. 
Seven charges of assault and three more charges of cheating and sexual harassment, in addition to the seven charges of assault related to the incident, were admitted by that person in the period between August 2016 and April 2017. 
The 12-year-old girl who was molested in the alleyway, when she returned to look back at that time, saw the person's hand holding a large bunch of bananas and a knife, and suddenly came out from the bushes. 
The child, crying out "Stop, stop, stop!" as he was pushed into the small courtyard, did not allow anyone to turn his head. 
That person told that woman: "Don't let the noise disturb you." 
I will burn you with a sword.
The man held a knife in his right hand, and the woman's hands and feet were tied with wires like cables. After that, he tied her to a tree, and then he committed sexual assault on her for almost an hour. 
After releasing that woman, the woman wept and ran to school. 
The person did not respond to the numerous phone calls and messages from his colleagues and did not come to work until around 9:30 am. 
He said that he drove another driver into the bushes and made him fall into the riverbank. 
The inquiry into the punishment of that person is being continued on Wednesday. 
Artificial intelligence should be used for the benefit of general goodness, not for the benefit of a few individuals 
The Pope warns that the general assessment of the common good, which is linked to the evaluation of digital advancements in artificial intelligence, nuance, and other forms of digital progress, should be accompanied by a competition, otherwise it may lead to increased social unrest and danger. 
The Pope delivered a speech to a gathering of scientists, engineers, and diplomats from various countries, including the ambassadors of the government and representatives of Google and Microsoft.
The title of the meeting was "Digital Age of Public Good" and the participants included educators and Catholic bishops. 
The contemporary authority for the statement that the computer's capabilities and vulnerabilities, as well as the debate surrounding them, are the focus of this three-day meeting. 
The state of affairs in that debate, where technological advancements and machinery are related to the method of war, is a situation where the future of work is increasing, and it includes the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand and the video related to that massacre that spread after it, and the decisions taken by social media institutions. 
When he spoke at that meeting, he praised the potential of technology to protect workers from hazardous and monotonous jobs, which is the starting point of industrial revolution, and to promote the development of industry. 
The man warned that the robots will cause harm to humans by only considering profits and not valuing the dignity of humans, which is the purpose of human life. 
Translation: "If technological advancement is the cause of the externalization of problems, then it will not be a genuine and honest progress." 
If the technological advancement of humanity is opposed to the general welfare, then the powerful will be the law, and this will lead to a disastrous outcome. 
The organizers of the meeting said that they expect participants who have expertise in the field of technology and related matters to provide guidance to the Catholic Church in the future. 
The real Madrid, led by Martin Odegaard, made a great effort, which moved the fans and gave them a sense of pride. 
The first goal of Michel Oyarzabal's first goal was helped by Martin Odegaard's pass, and he broke his voice. 
The Real Madrid team, which has not lost in any of the domestic competitions this year, won 2-0 against the Osasuna team and went on to the top position in the La Liga competition. 
Even though there is a previous state of being unable to get out of the rut, due to the fact that the team is in a state of being unable to get out of the rut, and the team is in a state of being unable to get out of the rut, the team is in a state of being unable to get out of the rut, and the team is in a state of being unable to get out of the rut. 
After Paris-Saint-Germain (PSG) was defeated humiliatingly in the Champions League matches, this pressure reached its peak. 
But the members of the Jin and Real Madrid are real talents, some of whom are currently working on this Frenchman's plans, while others are not.
Vinicius Junior will be a star in Real Madrid's galaxy in the future, he is currently in the team. 
Although Real Sociedad was given a debt to another Norwegian youth player Martin Odegaard, during a La Liga match, he is creating a commotion by making a move that captures the heart of the fans. 
When Real Sociedad plays against Athletic Bilbao, and they win 3-0 at home, Michel Ordóñez's first goal is helped by Martin's pass.
After taking the ball to the right side, the opponent's strong player deceived one of the other players, took the ball and went away, causing a big trouble, and then cleverly handed the ball to his own strong player, who was in the middle, and helped him to kick the goal. 
The second goal of William Joseph and the outstanding performance of Oyariyapabal, which was obtained through a penalty shootout, gave an easy victory to the Manolin team, and before the game ended, the midfielder of the Alaves team, Mau García, was sent off in a situation where there were only 5 minutes left to play. 
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but he was unable to fulfill expectations. 
It is like starting to play a game in a new way, like a 20-year-old Norwegian young man, in this moment. 
The name of Sarath Pawar is being mentioned in the case of Maharashtra state co-operative bank fraud, and Anna Hazare is astonished 
Anna Hazare said, "At the time when this case came to me, Sarath Babu's name was not in the list." 
The name of the Maharashtra state cooperative bank's president, who is a national leader of the Congress party or the EBC, is being dragged into the scandal of the bank's embezzlement, which is valued at millions of rupees, and social activist Anna Hazare has expressed surprise over this. 
The investigation agency, CID, has filed a case against Sarath Pawar, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and his nephew Ajit Pawar, along with others, in connection with a corruption case. 
The case information report regarding the investigation under the Economic Offences (Prevention and Control) Act, 2004, which was registered under the Central Bureau of Investigation, has been filed. 
The case is based on the first information report of the Mumbai Police's first information report, which includes the names of 70 former officials, including the former head of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and the founder of this cooperative society, Bharatiya Mahila Bank.
When this case came to me, Sarath Bavarin's name was nowhere to be found.
The following is a conversation between Annan and Hasare. Annan asked Hasare, "It is said that Sarath Pavaru is related to this crime. What is his name and who mentioned it?" Hasare replied, "Only they know, it is not known to anyone else." 
Anna Hazare, who is scrutinizing the Central Bureau of Investigation, said that after conducting a detailed investigation into this corruption, the truth will come out and the guilty will be punished, and that is his faith. 
Anna Hazare, who has fought many battles against corruption, said that "In this case, it will be clear to the government that how her name came up."

The former Central Minister, Delhi, said that he is not going to be a puppet of the authorities, and he has clearly stated that the leadership in the middle is not going to be a puppet of the authorities. 
The current case of the department of implementation is a political case with internal motives, according to the CPI. 
The 20-year-old man, Sindemba Entlo, a student at the University of Kwazulu-Natal, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend. 
A person who was arrested in connection with the murder of a student at the University of Nottingham (UK) and is currently being held in prison, is expected to be produced in court next week, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA).
The one who was accused of a crime was sentenced to death by the magistrate's court for the murder. 
The case related to the Beilu case was postponed to October 2, according to Nadaasha, a news correspondent of News24, who reported that the case was adjourned. 
The government will not allow the person who has been accused of a crime to be released on bail. 
The police spokesperson, Tembega Emphil, said that the 20-year-old man who was arrested on Sunday for a crime was found to be in possession of a firearm.
Entloov தனது இடது அக்குள் மற்றும் வயிற்றுப் பகுதிக்குக் கீழே குத்தப்பட்ட்தாக, முன்னதாக இந்த வாரத்தில் காவல்துறை கூறியது.
He is believed to be working as a mechanic in a car racing competition. 
Some girls who had watched some music performances after finishing their work time, were told by the officials of the motor racing competition that they had been working continuously without a break. 
The report states that one of them, who did not recognize the identity of the person who attacked them, was taken to the hospital and later died. 
The Kuajulu University of Natural Sciences has cancelled its scheduled performances and said, "The death of an Entlovin is a community, and it is necessary to think about the fragility of life and the frequent cruelties that occur in our society, and to ponder on it as a group." 
The verdict of the court is $30 million for the company
The court has ordered the founders of the company to pay $30 million as a result of their failure to disclose to the investors the outcome of the investigation related to the decision of the court regarding the dispute over the payment of the fee for the medical assistance provided to the company. 
The medical aid is classified as a public medicine, according to the classification of medicines and the transfer order, as stated in the circulars and the circulars of the transfer committee. 
Due to this reason, if it were classified as "Brand Name Medicine", the company would have provided an even smaller amount of discount to the government. 
This is in relation to the policy of coexistence with ESIC along with the agreement reached in July by Mailan. 
The institution does not accept or deny the allegations of misconduct made by SEI, but says it will investigate the matter further.

NASA announcement: We did not find Vikram Lander 
NASA has announced that it has not been able to find evidence of life on Mars.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has recently launched Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft to study the south pole of the moon. 
On September 7th, at dawn, the plan was made to land Vikram Lander on the surface of the moon. 
But at 2.1 kilometers distance from the lander, the communication link between the Vikram Lander and the ISRO control room was broken. 
The moon, which orbits around the earth, took a picture of the Apollo 2 spacecraft's landing site on the moon's surface, which showed that the Lunar Lander had landed and rested on the moon's surface. 
The 14-day life span of Vikram Landers has come to an end. 
The efforts made by the scientists of Israel in connection with it have not yielded any results till now. 
The aircraft, which had fallen from the sky with great speed, could have crashed onto the ground and broken apart, and as a result, it is considered that there was a possibility of damage to the aircraft. 
This is a quote from a news article. It translates to: 
Why did the mighty Isro rocket fail quickly?
It is a detailed report that will be published. 
NASA too attempted to find the place where Vikram landed. 
NASA's Apollo 11 has captured the picture of the landing site of Vikram Lander. 
NASA has announced that the location of the missing astronaut is unknown from the photographs taken by the Apollo mission.
In Tamil Nadu, there are more than 50,000 ancient artifacts, registered as archaeological properties, said Dr. C.R. Kayathiri, a senior archaeologist. She participated in the registration and awareness program of ancient artifacts at the Thanjavur Pudukkottai, which took place on a Wednesday. She then informed the journalists about it. 
Whether it is at home or at the institution, if there are any valuable items that are more than 100 years old, including paintings and handwritten documents that are more than 75 years old, they should be registered with the Indian Archaeological Department. 
Through this, we can obtain the proof for that property and hold it. 
The awareness of this is that from September 13th to September 28th, it will be conducted in each village. 
The awareness of the importance of registering ancient assets will lead to the realization of the value of registration, and where will the applications be granted, and who will register them? 
The information, including where to register, is being announced. 
We must not only record past events, but also change them. 
India is within everyone else, too. 
The above sentence can't be taken to foreign countries alone. 
If we register the ancient properties that are with us, they will be protected to us. 
That is a matter of great pride to us.
