The nuclear waste of the Croats will be a problem for the Bosniaks
The people of Croatia, neighboring Bosnia, who have been opposing the disposal of a part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region, which is located near the border with Bosnia and is renowned for its natural beauty and the river, numbering in the hundreds, were forced to flee northwestern Bosnia on Friday. 
The Bosnian refugees in Novi Grad, who are living in the old military barracks in Tkoska, have rejected the Croatian proposal to abandon the project to renovate their homes, and have decided to fight against the project. 
The waste of the nuclear power plant is disposed of in that place. 
The ones who came with the words "I want a healthy future" and "We want the Una River to flow" and carried flags with these slogans, are now saying that the nuclear waste will cause danger to the 250,000 people living in that area and the Una River.
We must say "no"! 
Miroslav Dereljaka, the great mayor of Novi, spoke thus at the gathering. 
We must necessarily fight to protect our way of life and our dignity. 
The factory located in Slovenia in the 1980s belongs to Croatia. 
The authorities of two countries will meet next week to discuss the disposal of excess waste and storage facilities. 
According to Croatia's National HRT Television on Friday, whether Croatia will take the opportunity to establish its own depositary or pay a fee to Slovenia to keep its share in the depositary is still undecided.
The Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy, Tomislav Čorović, stated that Croatia has problems with waste disposal from schools, hospitals and prisons, and that they are trying to find a solution to this problem, and that they are working on a comprehensive solution for the protection of the environment and energy. 
All the personnel, officials and residents from all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from all ethnic groups, have strongly urged that the other part near the nuclear power plant be chosen by Croatia.

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has accused the Uttar Pradesh government of being concerned only with publicity and not with the welfare of farmers. 
Priyanka Gandhi, the Public Affairs Committee, criticizes the various actions of the BJP government every day through social media platforms.
In this situation, yesterday the Uttar Pradesh government did not show interest in the welfare of farmers. 
The U.P. BJP government is only spreading lies and propaganda through hoardings and pamphlets against farmers.
Farmers have not received even their due share from the government up to now. 
The farmers are not provided with proper irrigation. 
But their electricity bill has been increased sharply. 
They are being deceived under the name of debt relief.
They were insulted by the government of the upper region, and said so.

The American Horror Story and Glee, created by Ryan Murphy, will feature Wayne Brady, Ben Platt, and Lucy Boyton in this. 
This performance, which does not speak much about this to those who have not seen it until now, is a story about the person who is truly taken care of by the one who takes care of the body or the mind, but pretends to have a physical or mental defect when they are in a state of well-being. 
That person is acting like they are sick in body, but actually they are fine, in this situation there are many varieties.
Although, especially in the case of Manushaha's case, it is as if you are watching someone who is not well in body, but is acting as if he is well.
This is a created or induced lack of ability, and is also called a deficiency, and is categorized as child abuse. 
This is a rather long sentence, so I'll break it down into smaller parts. Here's my attempt at translating it:
What are the signs of a broken heart? 
The symptoms of this state may vary from person to person, but according to the higher self, one must be aware of the following state with full awareness.
Even if their child is healthy, they make the doctors agree to something bad.
Exaggeration or lying about the signs
The conclusion that a child is not healthy is changed by changing the conclusions, for example, making them think that they have diabetes by adding sugar to the urine test.
The symptoms of a healthy state include providing unnecessary medicines or other things to those who do not need them, as an example.
Can one find the limit of the infinite? 
It is difficult to know how much this situation has spread because it is not talked about much outside. 
A study published in 2000 found that out of a population of 100,000, 89 people had this symptom over a period of two years.
If you think a child is in danger, what should you do?

Nigeria: The police arrested 300 children from the Kaduna school and took them to the Kaduna test 
The police of the state of Kudunah, located in the local government area of the state of Kudunah, in the town of Lein in the state of Kudunah, have searched the school run by Imam Ahmed bin Hambal, which is located in the town of Lein in the state of Kudunah, and have seized some of its property. 
The police accused the children of being in a state of being without human dignity; the school denied this accusation. 
One who introduces himself as a teacher in that school, saying "I am a teacher", will say something like: "What they say is not true because all the children are here only with their parents' consent. 
Before children are admitted to school, parents sign a form. 
The parents are accustomed to bringing food to their children every day, and they know the state in which they are. 
The police arrived before closing the school, and, along with the children being taken away by their parents, they also took away the food brought by the children, and we were extremely surprised. 
This is unjust because parents are saying that their children are being kept in a bad condition like the police are saying. 
The police officer who was in charge before, Abdurrahman, when he came to the school one time to see how the children were being taken care of, said that he did not hear any complaint. 
You said that children do not learn anything except the Quran. 
But the police officials, when Jacob Sappo spoke, said that the children would be handed over to their parents after being taken by the state government.
Those who call themselves Quranists, are placed in a situation where they are devoid of humanity. 
The thorns on their backs show that they have fallen at their feet. 
We are investigating in the school to know who the owner of the school is, because we want to know who the owner of the school is.

If there is only opposition for Vijay, then he is growing, said S. A. Chandrasekhar, his father and director.
The song release function of the film 'Pigil' was held recently in Chennai. 
Vijay, who was involved in the accident, said, "The driver of the lorry and the passengers who were injured in the accident are blaming each other, without knowing who is at fault. They are saying that whoever is responsible should be held accountable, and that if they are made to sit in the same place, it will be good."
The criticism against Vijay's speech is being strongly expressed in the AIADMK camp. 
At the same time, the leader of the people's justice, Kamal Haasan, has supported Vijay's speech. 
In this situation, Vijay's father, S.A. Chandrasekhar, has come to Tuticorin Airport from Chennai by flight today to participate in an event being held in Nagarkovil, Kanniyakumari district today.
The investigators at the site, who met Vijay, were inquiring about the criticisms that were to be expected.
The response to this was: While she was driving on the road in her car, the brake failed and she met with an accident, resulting in her death. 
The event is being discussed by everyone. 
Everyone who spoke was talking about one thing, and that thing was victory. 
The court is inquiring why the people connected to the case of the missing Subashree have not been arrested yet. 
However, only the thoughts expressed by Vijay are being opposed by the ministers, ADMK members, and others, and it is not clear why they are opposing. 
The meaning is: "If there is this much opposition to victory, then he is growing" 
If you speak, will there be this much opposition, or not? 
The meaning is: When Viji speaks, opposition arises, so he is growing. 
If one looks at the victory speeches, it is certain that he will come into politics. 
S.A. Chandra Sekhar said, "I don't know what it is that I want". 
We asked the ADMK people about this.
They said, "The death of Subrahmanya is a calamity, and there is no alternative thought." 
But, about that, didn't think immediately, Victory, Pigil, the music release function, why did you wait? 
Vijay acted, the audience of a film gave a standing ovation, and then fell down from the top and died. 
The video is also available. 
But they are saying that they cannot afford to give away their photographs, so they are saying that they are not willing to say it 
The news that is spreading on WhatsApp under the title 'A warning from dogs' for the past few days. 
The saying is that even if the dog bites, or if the dog's nail breaks, the children should immediately inform their parents about it. 
Because the child didn't tell his parents about being bitten by a dog, a 90% chance of contracting rabies virus was triggered in a small child, and a video was also linked to it. 
The video shows a scene where a child who received treatment at a hospital is crying like a dog.
Can dogs that have bitten people behave like dogs, and is the information spreading on WhatsApp true? 
If a dog infected with rabies virus bites, it is certain that the virus will also infect those it bites.
However, as the dog's nail scratches the body, rabies spreads. 
A dog that has been bitten by rabies may spread the disease if it licks its wound. 
The wound of the one who has been beaten, even if it is treated by a dog that has been bitten by a rabid dog at that place, will not spread the disease. 
Therefore, those who raise dogs in their homes should put a rabies vaccine as a precautionary measure.
The veterinarian said that because we need to give treatment to dogs, we also give them a booster shot once a year.

The terrifying middle coastal erosion, a child with a broken heart, has been ordered to appear in court 
The person who was wearing a dress made of leaves and hiding behind it, a 12-year-old child from that state, was taken away by someone from behind and dragged into the bushes when he was on his way to school, which is located near the central coast of the state in May 2017. 
The translation is: After that, he tied that child to a tree and committed sexual abuse on him. 
After being arrested, in a short period of time, an order was issued to search a house, and in connection with this investigation, the authorities seized many items. 
The person admitted to seven charges related to assault and also to three more charges related to misleading and sexual harassment of another woman during the period between August 2016 and April 2017. 
The 12-year-old girl who was molested on the road while walking, turned back and saw that the person who did it had a big branch and a knife in his hand, and suddenly emerged from the bushes.
When the child shouted "Stop, stop, stop!" and didn't let his head turn back, he pushed him into the small garden. 
That man spoke to that woman in this way: "Oh, don't make a noise." 
I will pierce you with a sword 
The translation is: Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied the woman's hands and feet with electric cables and then tied her to a tree, and then committed a heinous sexual assault on her for almost an hour. 
After releasing that woman, she wept and ran to school. 
The person did not respond to several phone calls and messages from his colleagues, and arrived at work around 9:30 am. 
He said that the other driver who had come with dust, thorns, and tree branches on his vehicle, had pushed another driver into the bushes and then fell into the canal.
The investigation into that person's punishment is continuing on Tuesday. 
Artificial intelligence shall be used by technical experts to benefit the general good. 
The digital advancements in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and other forms of digital innovation, with competition to create public goods, should be evaluated according to a moral framework that takes into account the common good, otherwise, it may lead to increased social inequality and the danger of creating a new form of slavery, according to Pope Francis. 
The Pope addressed a gathering of scholars in physics, philosophy, and law, along with ambassadors from the government, and representatives from Facebook and Google.
The title of the meeting was “Digital Age for Public Good” and the participants included educators and Catholic bishops.
The recent evidence for the argument that the debate on the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence is being driven by a desire to occupy a particular place is this three-day meeting.
The state of affairs in that debate is that the technological advancements and machines related to it are increasing, and the future of the work is becoming uncertain, and it is also related to the Christchurch massacre and the video related to that massacre that spread after it, and the decisions taken by the social media companies that were included.
The person, while speaking at that meeting, mentioned that the industrial revolution's starting point was marked by the protection of workers from hazardous and monotonous jobs, and praised the potential of technological advancement. 
The person warned that making only profit as the goal and being overly dependent on robotics would lead to a loss of human dignity and would put humans in danger.
The expert warned that if technological advancement is the cause of the external problems, it will not be a genuine and honest advancement. 
The technological advancement of humanity is called progress, but if it goes against the public interest, it will lead to a devastating consequence, as the saying goes, "the strong will be the law" and this is a terrible warning.
The organizers of the meeting said that they are looking for participants who have expertise in the field of technical skills related to the Catholic Church and can provide advice on future issues in this field.

The Real Madrid team, which did not lose in any of the domestic competitions this year, won 2-0 against Osasuna and continued to the top spot in the La Liga matches.

When Real Sociedad plays against Athletic Bilbao, and Real Sociedad wins 3-0 in their hometown, Michael Oyarzabal's first goal is assisted by Martin's pass. 
After taking the ball on the right side, one of the opposing team's players, who had been deceived, took the ball and went away, causing a commotion, and then, with great skill, threw the ball to his fellow player, who was on the other side, and helped him to kick the goal. 
The second goal of William Jose and the excellent performance of Oyariyal, who got the third goal through the penalty shootout, gave an easy victory to Immanuel, as the game was ending in five minutes, and before that, the midfielder Manu Garcia of Alaves was sent off. 
Martin Ødegaard joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but failed to meet expectations. 
Now I am 20 years old, a Norwegian youth, and it seems like I'm starting to play a unique role

The majority of the work has been completed. 
The statue will be placed in the worship area in the next few days. 
There was no one who attempted such a thing before this.
For this, we have collected donations from business organizations, public, and private organizations. 
When the ceremony of consecrating the idol is over, we will take back the gold that is inside it and use it for the next year's ceremony.

The mother who accepted the crime of killing her two teenage sons
The woman, who had planned to kill four more of her children after killing her two teenage sons, was told that the remaining part of her life should be spent in prison.
Saroa Paras, 35, killed his sons Tristan Paras, 13, and Blake Paras, 14. 
On May 24th, at around 7:30 am, the police were called to the Shire Green area of Sheffield, Yorkshire, after which two people died in a hospital 12 minutes apart.
The autopsy was conducted, but the verdict was not delivered during the investigation held at the Sheffield Crown Court on the day of the full moon. 
The situation regarding the death of children has not been known correctly until now.
Brendan Machin, a family member and partner in dispute, aged 39, came to the court. 
The individuals under the protection of the authorities, who were surrounded by two murder charges and one plan to kill six children, have confessed to one murder charge. 
During the 20-minute inquiry, the couple accepted all five charges related to the murder attempt. 
The accusations against him are related to the conspiracy to commit murder between May 14th and 20th. 
The four attempts to murder were charged in four indictments on May 23, including those of Blake, Tristan, and four children. 
The fifth charge against him is the attempt to murder on 24th May. 
The children who are lost shall all be below 13 years of age. 
Judge Jeremy Richardson, in that case, said: "The intensity of your actions cannot be explained by my words from any source. 
Your actions are speaking louder than your words. 
The murder of two children. 
The attempt to kill four children and the conspiracy to kill those children. 
The thought that each of you will be given a separate punishment of a lifetime for every wrong deed is not something that I doubt at all. 
The question of where the punishment for the entire life is meted out is a matter that requires the judgment of a judge. 
The punishment will be given to them on November 12th. 
NASA Announcement: We have failed to find Vikram Lander 
NASA announced that it was unable to find the Vikram lander near the moon due to lack of communication link.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) recently launched the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft to study the south pole of the moon. 
The plan was to land Vikram Lander on the surface of the Moon on September 7 at dawn. 
The communication link between the Vikram lander and the ISRO control room, which was 2.1 kilometers away from the lunar surface, was broken. 
The picture taken by the orbiter of the lunar module 2, which followed the moon, and sent back by the lunar module, shows that Vikram Lander had fallen and was lying on the surface of the moon. 
The 14-day life span of Vikram Lander has also come to an end. 
The efforts of Israeli scientists who have established a connection with it are not yielding results yet. 
The rocket that had fallen to the ground with great speed after being launched into the sky, may have crashed into the ground and broken apart, and as a result, a failure of the mission has been considered. 
After this, Vikram Lander, weighing 1471 kg, with a speed of 200 km per minute, was expected to land on the ground with an even greater speed, but it may have been damaged due to the mistake that occurred.
What is the reason for the delay in the Isro Vikram mission? 
The report is going to be published soon. 
NASA and America are trying to find the place where Vikram landed. 
NASA's Orbiter has captured the image of the landing site of Vikram Lander. 
NASA has announced that the location of the landing site in the photographs taken by the Apollo mission is unknown. 
More than 50,000 ancient artifacts, antiquities have been registered in Tamil Nadu, said Dr. C.R. Kayathri, a Archaeologist. She participated in the registration and awareness camp of ancient artifacts held at Thanjavur on Wednesday and later informed the journalists. 
If there are any materials that are more than 100 years old in the house or institution, including any paintings or handwritten documents that are more than 75 years old, they must be registered with the Indian Archaeological Department.
Through this, we can obtain a certificate for that thing and hold it ourselves.
The awareness program for this purpose will be held from September 13 to September 28, covering each village. 
What is the significance of registering ancient texts? Will applications be available everywhere, and who will register them? 
Information that is similar to where to register will also be announced. 
To record ancient values is not enough, but we can also transform them into something new. 
Give to others within India as well. 
The above sentence should be translated to English as: It is not possible to take only to foreign countries. 
If we record the ancient artifacts that we have at our place, it will be a protection for us. 
That is a matter of great pride for us. 
This many as 50,000 ancient and valuable artifacts have been registered so far. 
The records are being updated continuously. 
It is said that for the next 100 years, the museum will be able to register not only musical instruments, sculptures made of wood, toys, and stone sculptures but also other materials. 
The Tamil University, the leader of the Department of Fine Arts, Prof. Jeyakumar, laid the foundation stone of this camp in the past. 
In this, the images of ancient, old things, which were recorded, are being displayed. 
The public has seen this. 
The leader of the Pattali Makkal Katchi, Ramadoss, has said that people will be fooled by people who deceive and liars. 
In the public meeting held in Ranipettai, Vellore district, he spoke about this. 
The government has organized a felicitation ceremony last night for Rama Dass, the founder of Bama, for his persistent efforts to divide Velur district into three parts and submitting a petition to the government.
Ramaswamy, who had mixed with it, spoke with great passion. 
The DMK said that it was the first to raise its voice for the problems of the people of Vellore district, and that the PMK, the DMK, and other parties did not take up a struggle of the same magnitude. 
The leader of the DMK said that the votes are about getting power and that the people who are not concerned about the people will get power.
The former DMK leader, Ramadoss, said that the people who fought for the problems of Vellore district did not get the votes as they were expected to, and that they believed the lies of the opposition party and the false promises of the AIADMK and gave their votes to them. 
The question raised by Ramadas, who asked why those who work for the people's sake are deceived by the false ones, is that if the people's sake is behind, it is certain that good will happen to the people. 
If I am unable to walk on my own in my old age, I will still fight for this Tamil community, and I will tell them that those who came from Kodambakkam and entered politics are not the same as those who are big landlords in agriculture.

The friendship between businesswoman Jennifer Arquati and the police department's monitoring unit has been approved.
During the time when he was the Mayor of London, the Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently investigating whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for a criminal offense for mishandling his official position. 
The Greater London Authority (GLA)’s Monitoring Officer has recorded a matter related to conduct, it was reported by the organization in a statement, stating that the allegations were made against the Prime Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the close friendship he had with the Chief Minister, Mrs. Arun Jaitley, who was having a close relationship with the then Chief Minister, due to the
The information shows that there may have been a criminal offense and that it is related to a "moral issue".
This cannot be proven in any way, it is meaningless. 
Is it necessary for the IPCC to investigate that matter now? 
The IPCC has taken up the matter of complaints against the police in England and Wales.
At that time, Mr. Johnson, who was in a position related to the police and the criminal investigation department, was in charge of the monitoring setup.
John has denied that he has committed any mistake in his friendship with Mrs. Argyrou.
Their lawyer said, even if he says that he is not guilty of the crime committed against a wrongdoer, he will still provide the details of his connections with Mrs. Argyu to the London court as per the order of the court.
The American, Mrs. Arguric, who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 from the public fund, and when Mr. Johnson was the mayor, she was given permission to make three foreign business trips under the category of courtesy, according to a report published by the Sunday Times after the report. 
After that, the government has taken a decision to provide a grant of £100,000 to Heker House, the institution founded by Dr. Mrs. Arukuri. 
Before money is given, the procedures established for checking the accuracy of the transactions carried out beforehand are being confronted. 
Digital Minister Matt Warner said that his department is taking steps to “restore normal order” and that the company had a British phone number.
Although it is true, the calls made to the phone number 34, Mrs. Aruguri, which was previously a California office, have been transferred to a current office in California.
The friendship of the Prime Minister with the female entrepreneur is a secret known to all employees
The action taken by the GLA has led to the creation of a crisis in the freedom office responsible for the conduct of the state police, and a decision has been made to refer the matter to the Prime Minister's Office for further consideration. 
This is an attack motivated by political considerations, and at this time when the Conservative Party conference is taking place, it is being said that this is an "open politics" by a senior government source. 
The investigation officer has not brought forward any evidence or charges against anyone, and has not provided any opportunity to the Prime Minister to respond before releasing the report in the morning of the day after the incident. 
This was fabricated with a political intention and only the public and the media will come to know the truth. 
The close relationship between Mr. Johnson, a businessman from California, and the London Tourism Development Corporation, with the help of which he has been able to establish a close relationship with the employees of the corporation, was revealed today as a "well-known secret" to Standard.
The former officials of London & Partners (L&P), the companies of Mrs. Argyri, were referred to as "unreliable" by some at that time, but under the leadership of Mr. Johnson, who was the Mayor at that time, Mrs. Argyri was given a place in the foreign business trips that went abroad during that period. 
Three people accused him of having a drunken fight on the day of Mek Millar's death. 
The third person to be arrested in connection with the death of rapper Mac Miller, who died of an overdose last year in Los Angeles (LA), has been charged with drug-related offenses. 
The documents presented in court suggest that Stephen Walter sold oxycodone pills, which had been tampered with by Miller before he died, to thousands of people in America and Europe, including the UK, Germany and Italy, before his death in September. 
It is said that Walter was accused of selling the medicines that Müller gave to another person called Cameroon Petitt. 
The court documents released on Tuesday stated that Walter received a batch of prescription pills, including Xanax, from a pharmacy in August. 
Ryan Reynolds, who was arrested in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, this week, has been accused of being a "runner" who was carrying a series of warrants. 
Those who have not directly accused anyone of being responsible for Mill's death, nor have they filed a complaint. 
Walter, who was released from prison in 2005 as part of a drug case, will serve five months of imprisonment as per the condition of his release, for violating the conditions of his release. 
The lawyers who are handling this case, which was first reported by the popular website TMX, say that due to the high possibility of Walter fleeing abroad, he will remain in prison until the investigation is over. 
The mobile phone information sent to his lawyer has not been responded to yet. 
On September 4, the Federal Court indicted him on charges, and his lawyer refused to comment. 
The speech contains a detailed description of Mill's response, including his mental state and the use of medicinal marijuana, which has led to a few of the biggest figures in hip-hop becoming his fans. 
The one who had a true name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, also known as Pittsburgh's own, had a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, which ended in 2018. 
After his death, the singer posted a heartfelt video on her Instagram page, titled "Thank You Next," which featured a song with lyrics that affectionately mentioned him. 
The deaths of musicians associated with opioid use in recent years, including Miller's death, are one of them.
The guitar player who was in the 3 Doors Down band and consumed excessive amount of alcohol, Matthew Roberts, died in 2016. He had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his body.

The Health Minister, Tirivenkadam Singh Rawat, has said that if those affected by dengue fever take 650 mg of paracetamol medicine, it is enough, and it is not necessary to take a large amount of it. 
The Chief Minister's frivolous speech has caused a great controversy in the state. 
In the state of Uttarakhand, more than a thousand people are being treated for dengue fever. 
The government has not taken any action to prevent the crisis, and the opposition parties, including the Congress, are accusing it of being responsible for the crisis. 
The Chief Minister, who had said that the damage was minimal due to the government's timely intervention, visited the people who were injured in the Dengue fever and undergoing treatment in government hospitals. 
If he had investigated the good, he would have come, but even his advice, which he gave, has led to controversy. 
The doctor said that if you take 650 grams of paracetamol instead of 500 grams and rest, the fever will go away. 
The person who has been affected by dengue fever and has not taken medicine on their own and has not received proper treatment is being told by the health officials that they should seek medical treatment in a proper manner.
The current Chief Minister was the one who, a few months ago, when the wind was blowing from the cowshed, stood there and took a deep breath, saying that if one takes a deep breath there, the respiratory problem will be cured. 
A 9-year-old Nigerian boy has created more than 30 mobile phone games. 
A 9-year-old boy is creating a free programming language called Scratch 2 and is using it to create a game called "Kannamoochi" (a type of game played in Tamil Nadu). 
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline. 
He has created over 30 games for mobile phones, using the skills he acquired until now. 
The boy has hidden the ball in the game so that it would not be found. 
The one who gets the butterfly that comes out of its cocoon every time it breaks free, gets a point. 
I learned how to create a game in a boot camp. 
Paschal said to CNN: "At this moment, when I'm about to go into battle, I'm creating a game and I'm feeling very excited." 
In the month of March, from 5 to 15 years old children, one 5-night camp was organized by his father and he was included. 
The camp organized by the Codex International Foundation, like a child's game, allows children like Basil to engage with advanced technologies such as robotics and virtual reality as they grow up.
His father was Basil Okpara, a senior, who used to play many phone games in his growing-up period, according to him. 
He always had a ball in his hand so that he could play at any time, and when he was 4 years old, I gave him a table tennis table. 
He played cricket and temple run a lot,” his father told CNN.
The father had planned for his child to spend all his time playing, but after his father's plan was implemented, the child created his own games at the age of 7 due to his own enthusiasm. 
On that day, as usual, he was playing cricket with his friends on his laptop, and that made me angry. 
I asked him, "Do you ever think that you are always playing, and others are playing your game, and that you are creating a game for yourself about whether others are playing your game or not?"
When they said that, I was angry, but what they did with great enthusiasm, I didn't know,” he said further. 
He learned to create games from scratch, with great enthusiasm, and his parents bought him a computer to help him learn the basics of creating games. 
The scientist who aspires to be in the future, names his discoveries based on what they are related to, in relation to his games. 
One of his games, "Mascot Mash", is available on Google Play Store. 
Africa has the largest number of young people in the world, and when it comes to innovation, the people of this continent are at the forefront, just like the hungry ones. 
Twelve-year-old Nigerian children, two of them, have been praised recently for creating algorithms for robots to do their household chores.
The girls of Kanya Maha Vidyalaya, Kanana, who are part of the Agronauts team, which is a team of high school students, created a program to stack petri dishes for robots and won the 2019 RoboFest competition. 
Large technology companies like Google and Microsoft are increasing their investment in Africa, and Basil and his friends are becoming the pioneers of the future. 
The former leader of the North Carolina Republican Party admits to the crime of lying during the investigation into the lunch.
Federal officials have been told that former leader of the Republican Party, Carolinian, will admit in court that he lied when he said that federal officials would investigate the corruption case of a major politician and that he would not be involved in the investigation, according to court documents filed on Friday.
Robin Hayes next Wednesday will confess the crime, according to the Federal Court records.
The document prepared as a part of the agreement, signed by Hayes' lawyer, contains information that is not true, and it is said that Hayes knew that the information he provided to the FBI agents who conducted the investigation in 2018 was false. 
The confession of guilt is a signed agreement, it does not specify the particular charges that he admits to. 
The accusations against him at the beginning included deceitful plans, bribery, and spreading false information that was contrary to the truth. 
The head of the insurance company, who was a former member of parliament, was accused by lawyers of having a connection with Hay's case, as a result of which he received special treatment in the election campaign, and the company's order was made to pay a compensation to the party that received the insurance coverage.
The state insurance commissioner, Mike Kassev, has been accused of accepting bribes from Greg Lindberg and his associates, two individuals. 
The founder of the insurance and investment company, Liberty, is a prominent political donor in the state, having given over $5 million to state and federal candidates since 2016. 
He held a strong belief in the policies of the ruling party and its politicians, but he donated to the party of the people. 
The lawyer of that person did not respond to the email sent to him after inquiring about the matter and waiting for a response. 
Heysucks to lawyer, Courts Davis, did not respond to the email sent with the request for further consideration on the day of the full moon. 
The employees of the state insurance department have never spoken to the CBI agents at any time, including in 2018, and it is only now that a complaint has been filed with the court on the 24th of this month, according to the documents submitted to the court. 
He spoke the truth to the insurance director about Lindbergh's demand to change the employees who were under the supervision of the orderly arrangement and were working in the face of the organization's face. 
When Heyes was with Cash, he helped him and Heyes directly discussed the matter of lunch with the recorder and got advice from him, as the lawyers said. 
The accusation released in April stated that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance business, and that he had allocated up to $2 million for the 2020 re-election campaign of Kaese.
The indictment alleges that the company is replacing the head of the department that conducted the study with a new one. 
The Federal investigators, who are part of the ruling party, told Kashe Fedral investigators that he had tried to bribe them, and he would help them file a case against him. 
There is no accusation against him. 
In a conversation between Lindberg and Casy, Lindberg's partner at one point told Hayes that they would send $250,000 to support Casy's counter-mobilization. 
Hayes, who initially refused the proposal, saying that it would be too much to handle, later changed his mind and accepted the proposal after the conversation was over.
It is said that Hayes said, "Whatever you all want, we will do it," and that accusation is leveling against him. 
"I'm going to make him do this." 
The officer in charge of the information at the Federal Attorney's office has not responded to the request for further information regarding the agreement related to the acknowledgement of the crime. 
The attempt to increase the well-being of users by hiding the count of preferences as a test is a trial 
The world's first test of the user's well-being is the willingness to register, respond, and share thoughts, but some Facebook users cannot even see this. 
This is a continuation of the Instagram experiment conducted in July in Australia, and these preferences will be private and only accessible to those who have seen it.
The trial of this Facebook page, which will start on Friday, will also start in Australia. 
The transformation is based on the concept of social comparison, which is the idea that people evaluate their own well-being by comparing themselves with others, as stated by Australian mental health experts, including Dr. Mia Karl, director of the Australian Mental Health Foundation.
According to Carl, the organizations that work with us, including anti-violence groups and mental health organizations, have provided us with genuinely positive thoughts. 
This translation is not accurate. The original text is in Tamil. Please translate it to English. 
He said that people would experience even more joy and happiness when they share this platform without considering it as a competition. 
The occupations that are connected with the face book shall continue to receive the same level of attention and the same perspective as before, Carl said. 
The person said that it is impossible to say that the test will be done in other countries as well, just like it is being done in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland, before it is actually done. 
The owner of Instagram, in the same way that it is in Instagram, it is not clear when this test will be over or if this change will be permanent or not. 
The person said, “This experience (on Instagram) has now given us some initial thoughts from the public, but we are still learning and observing from them.” 
When talking about the world being a testing ground, he said on his Facebook and Instagram that Australia has many technology-savvy users. 
Is it not a valuable experience for the people who use our services, that it is not just a thought, but a reality that we are the best country, and we can get the best ideas and thoughts, and we can achieve the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be the best, and we can be
Every human being is grateful to the parents who brought him up and made him a person.
The sacrifices made by parents to bring up a child cannot be measured. 
It is the duty of the scriptures to continue to show gratitude to their lives, just as it is necessary to provide all the necessary help to them during their lifetime, after their lives too.
They brought about a crisis because of that. 
They call this by many names such as Dharma, Pitru Karma, and Punya 
With gratitude, they will say it is necessary to do it with careful attention, without forgetting, and with diligence, as if it is a must-do task, and they will call it "diligence always".
The divine poet Tiruvalluvar, in the Tirukkural, says that the Lord of the southern region is the one who is pleased with the offering of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) and that He is the one who is referred to as "ஐம்புலத்தாறு ஓம்பல் தலை" (Aim-pulaththar oom-pal thalai) which means "The Lord who is pleased with the offering of the five elements". 
The phrase "தென்புலத்தார்" mentioned in this refers to the ancestors who are no more. 
The world of our ancestors is located in the southern direction, therefore they call the world they live in "the southern region". 
Although it was decided to do the annual accounting after many days, it is necessary to do the accounting on the 15th of every month. 
Some people give only on certain days like Thaipusam and Amavasai. 
If one does not achieve the ultimate goal, even on a full-moon day, without doing the ritual, it will be of great merit.
At this moment, our ancestors are all returning to the earth, as per the myth.
At the time of the offering, one uses ghee, water, pinda, rice, banana, and betel leaves. 
The scriptures say that the gods will hand over these to the ancestors.
The ancestors who came to see their children in this world will return to the world of the ancestors today. 
The acts of this day, such as taking a bath in the holy waters, performing the worship of the Lord, guiding the devotees and helping the family to prosper and grow, and to grow old with a peaceful mind, are all helpful in achieving the ultimate goal of life.

The Tamil Nadu government has asked the Chennai High Court to raise a question as to why the government medical colleges for students who studied in government schools do not provide separate quota.
The 207 seats allocated for foreign students of Indian origin in private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu are still vacant, and therefore, have been allotted to colleges affiliated to the administration. 
The person who was a member of the Kovai and was a champion in the case of the proper investigation of the places, filed a case in the Madras High Court.
The case was heard by the judges, including Kripakaran and Velmurugan. 
When V.P. Raman, a lawyer who was present in the Indian Medical Council, was speaking at the time, after the three-tier examination, if the places where Indians living abroad were vacant, a list of 10 students for one place would be sent to the concerned college based on the foundation.
The list shall be filled in accordance with the rules of the university. 
But did he not say that the bottom line of that list was not filled?
The additional Chief Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu, Arvind Pandian, will be speaking when the list of vacant posts related to the colleges will be sent to the concerned colleges.
The merit of the good will fill the empty spaces. 
But, how the colleges are filled is not known. 
This has nothing to do with the Supreme Court and no further action will be taken. 
The judge ruled that the government should take necessary steps to provide suitable accommodations for Indian citizens living abroad, and to ensure that their rights are protected in relation to the allocation of places in India. 
The lawyer who appeared for the defendant, Velmurugan, told the court that 207 vacant seats and low-scoring students had been sold at a higher price.
The investigation is needed to find out why those who study in private schools for higher education and government medical colleges are not given separate seats in government medical colleges, and why only those who have a reserved list of vacant seats are given the opportunity. 
Here's the translation: 
This is the injustice that doctors are made to suffer. 
The following 10 standalone medical colleges in Tamil Nadu are hereby ordered to be included as respondent parties in this case. 
The students who are studying in the hostels of foreign countries, the students who have obtained their grades, are required to submit the information about their grades to the college by October 15th.
The social media influencer of Pakistan, Qandeel Baloch, was honored with a death sentence 
Quantum physicist Palo Alto 2016 July was killed.
In the highest position in the country, the Pakistani social media influencer was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his brother, who was killed in the "Gaurav killing" incident on the day before the previous week, for the murder of his brother, who was killed in the "Gaurav killing" incident on the day before the previous week. 
The Pakistani who was captivated by Western culture, but had a deep disgust for women, was beheaded in July by the Taliban for his self-proclaimed selfies.
His brother Muhammad Waasim was arrested.
The person said: "It's not a matter of regret for me, what I did, because I killed my sister. My sister's behavior was extremely annoying. I've spent a few days and then met a reporter and told him. " 
The eastern city of Moulton, where the verdict was long awaited, has sentenced its own party member to life imprisonment, according to the lawyer of the accused, Mr. Muhammad AFP.
He said that by the will of God, he will be set free in the court of higher justice. 
The father of the Palestinian people, Anwar Mua, believes that his son will be freed from prison and that the AFP has informed him of this.

She said, "She is my daughter, he is my son." 
The killing of a woman - often a woman - who is killed for having gone against the social norms of a society that is accustomed to killing women for having gone against international norms, is called a "honor killing" and it is necessary to take action against it. 
The men who have chosen their own husbands or have got their daughters married off like a commodity, or have brought shame to their families by committing such heinous crimes, are being burned, shot, and hacked to death, and their necks are being broken. 
The one who is closest to us has committed these murders as a habit. 
The Quwaja (blood money) and Diyat (compensation) law of Pakistan, according to which, the relatives of the victims can demand forgiveness from the perpetrators. 
The parliament passed a new law making it mandatory for those who commit honor killings to receive life imprisonment three months after the murder of a person who has been killed for not following the family's wishes. 
Is it the judge's discretion whether a murder should be considered a murder or a sacrifice, and if so, can the perpetrators of murder use this as a reason to claim pardon for their crime? 
The parents of the victim, at the beginning, had strongly insisted that their son, who was killed by the murderer, should not be granted pardon. 
But they said that they would give up their son and change their minds, and forgive him, and that is what they said. 
Although, due to the international condemnation of the killing, the Pakistani government has taken the unusual step of declaring itself as a party to the case, along with the parents, in order to move the case forward. 
The Pakistani cricket team's jersey and the way they wear it on Valentine's Day, with a scarlet jersey, is one of the well-known actions of all. 
The punishments and threats that arose as a result of this, although they were as fierce as those of Kim Il-sung, were seen as a political maneuver to assert the authority of women, and in a country where this was seen as a new phenomenon, even young people were included. 
The roots of honor killings are in the social norms of the tribal community, which are widespread throughout South Asia, and they can affect men as well, but they dictate the behavior of women. 
We are losing the ground water drop by drop today. 
We are just starting to realize the importance of palm trees now.

Oh, the sorrow of the elephant that has lost its life! 
The animals that spoke about this are good natured, "In the year 2004, this was changed to Brad Cage.
After that, many trains are operated on this route. 
The number of trains has increased, as a result, the number of elephant deaths has also increased. 
This part is a path for elephants. 
We went to the Railway authority and informed them that due to the high-speed trains running in this area, elephants are getting injured and dying in accidents. 
The order was given to operate the trains at a reduced speed in this area after that. 
This is due to the reason that calamities have decreased.

The social workers have informed that the assistance for maternity benefits has been stalled for the past year in Tamil Nadu. 
The Doctor Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternal and Child Health Scheme has been launched in the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, for the benefit of poor pregnant women and their families, in the context of people's well-being and family welfare. 
The pregnant woman will receive Rs. 4,000 in her bank account within 12 weeks of admission to the scheme, after registering her name and providing necessary documents such as Aadhaar card, bank account number, etc. to the village and urban health workers. 
The 2nd installment of 4,000 shall be paid by the end of the 4th month, following that. 
The government hospital provides a total of Rs. 18,000 as assistance to the mothers, with Rs. 4,000 immediately after delivery, Rs. 4,000 after the 4th month, and Rs. 2,000 after the 9th month. 
The iron-rich, dried apricot, protein-rich biscuits, ghee, and almond oil included in the nutrient basket, which is similar to the development of the physical strength of women during pregnancy, is being provided. 
The program was implemented in a way that pregnant women can give birth to their children with a healthy body and nurture them to grow.
This program is very useful for pregnant women who are in a middle-class or poor state. 
The government has stopped providing the maternity assistance package to women who are pregnant for more than a year. 
The social workers say that, in connection with this, "The 18-month assistance package provided to pregnant women for the sake of their well-being and family well-being has not been disbursed for more than 13 months. 
This has led to maternal and child health being affected in a significant way during pregnancy. 
The debt to be repaid for the upbringing of a child has been incurred and the expense has been made. 
The situation is such that only a cupboard of leftovers is being provided, and as such, it is not being credited to the account of the assistance amount in the bank until the day arrives. 
The government has not yet provided the first installment of the grant as per the discussion with the health department officials related to this matter.
The central government has paid a total of Rs. 2 lakhs as the first installment, and the remaining Rs. 16 lakhs will be credited to the bank account. 
The government of Tamil Nadu has registered the applications of pregnant women who have requested assistance in childbirth, but it is uncertain whether they will be granted the assistance. 
The government should take a decision to provide the maternity assistance immediately, which has not been provided for over a year.

The TV rights holders have revealed that the reason for the event being called "Can't happen at any time" is because the anchor of the Glasgow pronunciation at his place said it. 
In the broadcasting industry for 35 years, Kelly, 59, who appeared on screen for the first time, recalled feeling "very nervous" before his debut. 
When I was 25 years old, I was very busy. 
I used to work as a researcher in the BBC Scotland, but my boss, due to my Glasgow accent, said that I would never be able to go on television. 
I went to London before taking up my responsibility at the Glasgow office, so that I could watch the TV crew filming the event and all the participants, including them. 
In that time, diamond and Mike Morris, both of whom were famous, were interviewing the famous Pat Davis, and I will never forget it. 
The great fame that one person had in that same room, I could not believe that I was also in it. 
This is the place I wanted to be.

Jimbapwe: Sikikkovalvu kurtitu Sivenga payanthaar
The former President Robert Mugabe refused the opportunity given by the then President at the peak of the revolution, and he thought that it was a trap set by the military to gain power and hand over the government to the military in November 2017, as per a senior government official. 
The Independent of Zimbabwe, last week, said that after the revolution, the President would take up the position of Commander-in-Chief, and then he would have a meeting with the military leader Sivenga at his place. 
Although he had been afraid of Sivengka's threat, he did not reject this opportunity, and in reality, he proved to himself that he could use his position as a world leader and the chairman of the African Union to demonstrate his plan to Sivengka, and he had learned that Sivengka had known about his plan.
The 37-year-old President of Zimbabwe, who was ready to hand over power to Mnangagwa, but the President's office and the Ministerial office did not confirm it, was confirmed by high-ranking government officials in a Twitter post by Jamwandu 2.
The messenger who realized that the power was being wielded from his own hands, approached Sivengka through one of his messengers. 
According to the statement of that high-ranking official, in the military command, there were three people between the then Prime Minister and the late former President, who were acting as mediators. 
The officials who are involved in the negotiations include George Sarampa, who was the head of the Central Investigation Agency at that time, and Aaron Napera, who was the head of the agency, and Gregory Fidelis, the Roman Catholic Bishop, and others, according to the official. 
The former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, personally dispatched a person who had been involved in a conversation with Sibengwa, who was the commander of the Zimbabwean security forces (ISF), to give him the opportunity to become the President of Zimbabwe.
He who lived with life, and after death was described as the symbol of Africa, in the same breath, he called for the recognition of the African Union's military operations, but in vain. 
The former Prime Minister (Mr. Muthuvel Karunanidhi) has not chosen to confer the position of Governor on the Chief of the Special Forces (Major General Shiv Shankar) who was with him at the time.
The official (Jamwantda) wrote: "It is an attempt to rectify the deteriorated situation, which has grown into a danger at a rapid pace, without losing faith; it has turned a part of the family of the hidden leader into a battleground." 
But there was also a little bit of political maneuvering, and at least it would have maintained the situation in a state of equilibrium, according to the hidden President. 
The leaders' resolve to not change the political order, to recall their promise "we will not change the order, we will change" and to take a stand with the African Union's stance on revolutions, which will lead to a confrontation with them. 
The then CEF (Sivengka) in the engineering department will not be able to change the constitution through its own means, the words of the generals will become certain and the former President (Mukabae) believed it. 
The African Union, which was very uncertain about how to take this situation, which had considered various options, finally decided to call it a revolution, as there was a need for military intervention, and it was believed that it would be a revolution that would be accepted by the international community. 
The opportunity was given to me after I thought in this way and calculated it. 
When the additional security forces realized that they were unable to protect themselves, they were told by the authorities that they had taken this action.
Is it true that the army warned him that there was a danger that he would be killed like a dog and that's why he wrote a resignation letter? 
The military leaders told him that if the people of his province would not protect him, they would not protect him from the people of his province. 
The official said, "At that time, he needed to protect his family and establish the army's control, and he had two desires, one was to protect his family and the other was to establish the army's control." 
When the situation arose, the captain and officers understood the intention correctly. 
The messenger who brought the news that had lost faith, (or) isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we are not those who show ourselves, that is, we are not soldiers); we are not politicians or those who are in the political game, said the high-ranking government official.
In Zimbabwe, the ruling party's goal is not to remove Mugabe, but to keep an eye on the "criminals" surrounding him, according to government officials. 
The way to discuss the revolution and governance is to recall how we, who had taken temporary refuge in South Africa, were deceived by the Nangavala group and were called back to return, and to use the same strategy to deceive and call back the Mubai group. 
The conversation with the military was conducted, except for the fact that he also asked for assistance from that region. 
The key individuals in this process were South Africa -- not only because of their economy and regional power, but also because of the then President Jacob Zuma's leadership as the head of the African National Congress, which refused to back down, but ultimately, the army entered the Mugabe's house, which made the South African army to come to Harare immediately. 
The news agency Independent reported that the African leaders and novelists did not accept it, so it did not happen. 
The Education Minister, Agil Viraj Kariyawasam, has stated that the education provided in national schools will be free for all students, including those who are pursuing higher education. 
Yesterday's meeting of the education minister with the media personnel at the education department was held 
The decision has been made to provide DEP to teachers who teach high-level education in national schools. 
The action of providing one lakh debit cards for this project has been initiated. 
The Minister said that in addition to the first class students who will be studying in other schools, the teachers who will be teaching them will also be provided with a stipend. 
The educational minister has said that this system will lead to a transformation of education, which will be introduced after free education is implemented in the country. 
The guidance China needs is strong leadership, otherwise it will be a policy of 'to let go' 
The government has stated in a policy document released on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, celebrated on National Day, that if the Communist Party of China does not have the strength to lead the country in a unified manner, the country will "lose its way" and that the people will not be able to govern themselves. 
China's Foreign Ministry said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communist Party took power 70 years ago is attributed to the Party's leadership. 
In China, it is the largest, its national conditions are complex, and its administrative difficulties are rare to be found. 
"The situation where there is no unity and no strength of leadership, China will split, and it will bring about a major disaster to the world," it said.
The Chinese authorities have been justifying their suppression of the democratic movement in 1989, by saying that it is necessary for the national stability, just like they crushed the iron-fisted way the problems that arose during the time of the people's leader in 1989. 
The leader, Xi Jinping, who will head the celebrations of the second largest economy in the world on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's rule and has controlled those who could challenge his authority since he took office in 2012.
The G-to-M oversight has led to the modernization of the military program in that region, which has caused unrest.
China does not expect any other country to copy its model, nor does it expect others to form an alliance with it. China wants nothing but peace, and that is the only policy guideline. 
The idea that one should conquer others and dominate the world is not in the genes of the Chinese.
Modern China, which is being threatened by the great powers, is facing the consequences of war and pollution, and has experienced great suffering; China will never let others experience the same hardships it has. 
China is celebrating this New Year's festival in a situation where it is facing challenges such as the economic downturn and anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which are opposing the government, in a state of confrontation with the United States in a harsh trade war. 
China's benefits will never be given away, and it will not compromise on its security and sovereignty, as stated in the note. 
According to Washington, the trade problems with Washington, which include the trade war-related challenges and the increasing tariffs, cannot be solved. 
The translation is: 
Business wars will never weaken this. 
China is able to overcome difficulties, transform obstacles into stepping stones, and create a new world with confidence. 
The intention is not to challenge America, but to change America, and that is not China's intention, so China's progress should be observed by America with a discerning eye, and that's what it further said. 
America cannot control China, and there are no possibilities of hindering China's development either. 
Translation: It is not the act of preventing other countries from being influenced, suppressing them, or dragging internal problems of other countries into the international arena that makes America strong. 
The first day of a fever, which is caused by Dengue, will have common symptoms such as cough, fever, headache, and body ache.
If a fever lasts for two days, it will become severe on the third day. 
The pain that cannot be borne by the eyes, cannot be measured by the body. 
The blow will be as severe as a broken bone, and it will be a complete and utter defeat. 
The face is like a mirror that reflects the impact of the storm. 
The face is worn out. 
The appearance of red spots on the body is a major symptom of Dengue fever. 
The tests for Dengue IGM and Dengue IGG, including blood tests, are necessary. 
The number of red blood cells in a healthy person's blood is approximately 3 million. 
If the fever of Dengue comes, the number of patients in the wards will be less than 20,000.
Therefore, we need to conduct an investigation to know the number of heartbeats. 
There is no special treatment for Dengue fever, treatment is only given to symptoms. 
Because of this, it is said that preventing a small disease from spreading is better than curing a big one. 
Today is the beginning of the Navaratri fast. 
The important festival of the Hindus, one of which is Navaratri, begins today. 
The fast of Navaratri will be observed until the 7th day. 
The devotees who observe the nine nights of Navaratri and keep a fast, should eat only after worshipping the Goddess, and then they should sleep on the floor, without pillows or bed, on a mat. 
If the Moon is in the ascendant in the Pratima Lagna, it will be a very auspicious day. 
On that day, the goddess will give everything they want to those who worship her. 
It is necessary to worship the goddess Parashakti for the sake of bravery and courage for the first three days.
The next three days, we must worship Mahalakshmi to get wealth.
The last three days, one should seek knowledge, wisdom, and all the arts, and worship the goddess of arts. 
The women of noble character, who were called to the house during these sacred days, were treated with great respect and reverence, and were given gifts such as saffron, sandalwood, silk, and coins, and were seated near the Lord's feet, where they were worshiped. 
The oil extracted during the Navaratri festival is not used. 
The thread of a needle cannot be cut with a needle 
The fast of Saturn on the days of Navaratri is not to be broken by drinking oil. It can be kept by bathing and observing the fast. 
The act of worship through the burning of ghee is also possible. 
Those who wish to observe the nine-day Navaratri vrata, shall fast during the day and break their fast at night after performing puja, and shall have only milk and fruits, and shall observe complete abstinence on the tenth day, and shall perform parayanam by 8:30 am on that day. 
The ones who cannot be satisfied will eat a little food at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day, they will only be able to drink milk and eat a fruit. 
The Puranas say that there are no other vows except the vow of simplicity, which is like the vow of Navaratri, and which can give abundant fruits. 
The vow of Navaratri is one that can grant all that a human being desires, including self-control, wealth, happiness, long life, health, heaven, and liberation. 
Children are a blessing for those who have no children. 
Those who are dull in their studies, will be able to attain a higher level by following this vow. 
The ones who are unable to worship for nine days, on the eighth day, they worship Durga and if they wake up in the morning, Durga, the goddess of life, will protect their lives. 
The same as the original star, or the new moon, we use the things we use daily, such as tools, children's books, in worship, and then on the next day, the day of victory, we use those things with special consideration. 
The worship of Navaratri, which illuminates the greatness of Shakti, is the most important duty of human beings, which includes education, wealth, and bravery. It is the desire of these three aspects that we seek Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Durga, who are the three aspects of Shakti, and worship them during Navaratri.
After Xi Jinping was elected as the second president of China, the communist government's grip on Muslims is still tight. 
Those who consider themselves as Muslims should live in that country with only one identity, that of being Chinese.
The customs and habits of eating shall be the basis for their being considered as Chinese in all matters. 
The period of 5 years has been given to the Muslim people to change. 
The envoys of the Jinping are meeting with the leaders of the Islamic organization to explain the government's stance and seek cooperation. 
The intention of the Chinese government is that the Uyghur people should lose their true identity and merge with the national stream. 
The Council of Human Rights of the United Nations has issued a strong condemnation of China on the eve of Human Rights Day. 
That is, the organs to be taken from the Falun Gong practitioners in the concentration camps by the Chinese government, are the heart, kidneys, liver, skin, etc.
China has denied the allegations, saying that the bodies of the executed criminals were indeed beheaded. 
But in 2015, we stopped doing that too. The International Council for Human Rights has stated that the accusation is baseless.
The hunger for food is a disease that follows after the trouble of eating spicy food 
The fruit and vegetables that she had not eaten for many years, except for a few, were banned from her house after she developed a serious health problem. 
The world-famous rock band that had been experiencing the pressure of fame, had a very limited diet, did exercises like "pull-ups" and came to know that later on, they had mental pressure and eating disorder. 
His own experience, he is growing up his daughter Scarlett in his own way, which is having a profound impact on him, and now he is saying, "No one is allowed to speak ill of anyone's food at our home." 
Mel said, "Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I have started paying attention to her appearance with great interest, as she is growing up."
However, at the time when he is present, I speak to him with great attention, and I consider it as one of the positive experiences that I have had, which is the opposite of the experience of being hungry. 
Straightforward speech – it has become a habit now.
MEL, who was a part of Spice Girls, a popular girl group in the early 1990s, said that when she spoke about women's health in a magazine, the magazine's readers found her opinions about her own body unacceptable and it led to her body-related problems. 
I started not taking care of myself properly, reduced my food intake, and started exercising like I was possessed, and I reached a state of extreme thinness, until...
I was in good health, and it lasted for about two years. 
The inquiry of the former athlete accused of sexual assault by many people is being held at the court 
The investigation into the former professional footballer of Delaware University, who was accused of sexual assault by multiple people, is currently underway by the judges. 
Ten days after the testimony and evidence, the judges began to investigate the future of 23-year-old Gleek Kanaveyan on Friday.

The tourist spot has become extremely dirty 
The Sydney Harbour is surrounded by iconic landmarks such as the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park, and the Harbour Bridge, and is a major contributor to Australia's economy, generating $21.9 billion annually, with the tourism industry being one of the largest contributors. 
But that which is below the bridge is a bitter truth. 
The Sydney Harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, with 15 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of pollutants entering the harbour every year.
The statistics of this place, which is a must-visit destination for tourists, is making this place one of the most unclean places among our places.
The city of Sydney, which has been named as above and below, has a new TV series. According to the instructions, the city of Sydney, which is famous in Australia, is surrounded by a lot of waste in the water, including plastic bags, bottles, and clothes, as well as dead animals, which are all being washed away through the stormwater drain. 
But we are the ones who have the greatest part in reaching our own spiritual paths. 
The documentary released on September 27, World Tourism Day, in collaboration with the Sydney Harbour Research Project, features Dr. Catherine Defran, Deputy Director of the project, saying, "I call this a mismatch."
It appears beautiful to behold, but it is one of the most polluted and dirty estuaries in our coastlines.
Every minute, around 1560 kilograms of plastic enters our waterways, most of which come from stormwater drains.
Doctor Defran said, "Following some events where it rained heavily in a very large scale, this port is in a very bad state." 
In this impurities, one-third of them come through the drainage system as rainwater.
But, in the state where 70% of the plastics that enter the ocean come to rest on the sea floor, the problem of Sydney Harbour, is like a giant iceberg, hiding beneath the surface.
The owner of the Menlo Dive Center, Richard Nichols, said that every year, he and his team take out 500 kilograms of plastic from the sea, and that "if you want to know what's really going on there, you have to go down there and spend time, only then you can understand."
If this were to be known by many people (like what is in water), they would be shocked. 
We are finding out that in a very large scale, almost all of what we are finding is plastic bags. 
The plastic items will be made up to at least 50% of the remaining quantity. 
When you look at the harbor, it will look very beautiful, but beneath its surface, there are all sorts of plastic and waste, which people will not believe. 
The local and tourist visitors both contribute equally to reduce the amount of plastic and waste in our pathways as per Jeremy Brown, Co-founder and Management Director of Ocean Protect. 
He said that it must start from the root. 
The amount of plastic we use should be reduced, and we should recycle it properly, and also, we should be aware that the waste we generate will eventually reach the ocean. 
If we pollute the ocean, we are destroying ourselves, because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean. 
That consumes 30% of carbon dioxide and food nutrients. 
But we can correct this harbor, bring it back to its old state, and that is very easy. 
If we destroy the ocean, we ourselves will be destroyed.
The video, produced by TOMRA, a recycling company, aims to raise awareness among Australians about the importance of protecting the environment and natural resources, and reducing the impact of plastic and mental health issues, in conjunction with a recent study released this month.
The thought experiment involving 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 showed that 82% of them did not trust plastic waste, and in addition, 25% of them blamed the elderly for the problem of plastic waste that is used only once.
The study found that among the 551 parents who were concerned about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean, 93% of them ranked plastic as their fourth most worrying issue, after climate change, pollution, and lack of education. 
We want to do something about the plastic waste, but those who have researched have said that they don't know how to create a difference, and this is causing an environmental stir. 
Archaeologists have discovered Pandyan-era inscriptions from the 13th century at the foot of Sivaganga near Kovalanur in the Pandiyar Kalvettu area. 
The director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Dr. V. Rajaguru, along with archaeologists Kollangudi Pulavar Kaliraja, and M. Vimal Raj of Ramnathapuram, conducted an excavation in the Kovalanur area of the Sivagangai district. 
When that time comes, six ancient inscriptions were discovered in the old well in Kovoor, located in the foothills of the Western Ghats. 
After examining all of them, the epigraphist Dr. V. Rajaguru said:
The city of Kovalanur has a river on its eastern side, and a canal from the north.
The ancient inscriptions, containing various information, are found in 6 fragments in the classroom of that school. 
The inscription starts with "Bhoomaruvia Thirumandalaiyum Bhuvimalandalaiyum" in the 9th line of the 9-line meikiruthi of the first Maravarman Sundarapandian, who ruled Madurai as the capital from 1216 to 1244.
The information included is that Thanjavur and Urandai were destroyed, the palace and the hall were demolished, and the details are recorded. 
The names of the officials of the government, including the leader of the treasury, Uzhakkudi Muththan, Tachchanurudayan, Veerapanchan, Munaittarayan, Azhaganan Vanavan, Vizhaya Rayan, and Vandan Rayan, are inscribed on this tablet. 
The countries of மிழலைக் கூற்றத்து, கீழ்க்கூற்று, மதுரோதய வளநாடு, கீரனூர் நாடு, காஞையிருக்கை ஆகிய நாடுகளும், and the villages of நல்லூர், மிழலைக் கூற்றத்து தச்சனூர், புல்லூர்க்குடி, மதுரோதய வளநாட்டு புறப்பற்று, காஞை
The inscriptions on the stone slab use symbols to indicate the measurements of the land, such as "கல்வெட்டில்" and "இருமா", which are used to denote the length and width of the land, respectively. 
The majority of long letters do not appear in inscriptions.
There are words "நீக்கி" in two inscriptions, one of which is very long, and the other very short. 
This part, except for this, is a region where the Sangam era's black and red pottery vessels are found in large quantities.

The Tasmanian devils can guide the way to cure cancer 
The Tasmanian devils can guide the way to cure cancer – Researchers have found a breakthrough in cancer treatment for the disease-causing ones.
Scientists have discovered how certain cancer cells hide themselves. 
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in both demons and humans. 
This discovery is expected to provide new methods for treating cancer patients 
What is common to the demons and men, according to the Dasmayan?
The disease that is not visible to the eyes, but is present. 
Researchers from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, including those who have come from the centre, have made a discovery that could revolutionize treatment for certain types of cancer, if they do not respond to conventional treatment methods. 
The main aspect of removing the impending dangers posed by the demonic beings of the future, which are about to destroy the world, could be in that. 
This research, using the PRSC2 type of proteins, found that some cancer cells, hiding themselves from the immune system, can evade the immune system's attack on cancer, and that some cancer cells in humans and in that organism can hide themselves in the same way.
This is a big challenge in treating small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma, among other types of cancer. 
The head of the research team, Peter Mack, said that in some cases, patients who are resistant to treatment for diseases, can be persuaded to return to the treatment process through this initiative, which is the greatest benefit of this project. 
The proteins known as MSI (Microsatellite Instability) which are functioning as guides, can be modified to change the target of current treatments, allowing the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.
The professor, Dr. Dason, said that it is possible for those suffering from lung cancer to have long-term benefits from this. 
This is one of the most common diseases in the world. 
We can treat it further with a more advanced method. 
The researchers believe that the same method used to identify cancer cells can also be used to identify the facial features of the Tasmanian devils and eventually put them to use in the end. 
Professor Dasan said, 'It is noteworthy that the same procedure (in humans as well as in the Tasmanian devil with a facial tumor) is taking place,' 
This has been the case until now, the treatment of Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease has been extremely difficult. 
But, if the medicines that act on human beings can also be used by the demons of Dasmayan, then it is possible that it can help in controlling that disease. 
In the context of land subsidence, the public should be informed by the construction research institute in a responsible manner.
The National Building Research Organization has informed the public that, in relation to the landslide that can occur after a prolonged period of heavy rainfall, it is necessary to take precautions with caution. 
The organization has informed the general public that it is necessary to be vigilant and take action in relation to landslides in the areas of புளத்சிங்ஹள, பலல்லாவிட, மத்துக்கம, அகலவத்த, எல்பிட்டிய, நியாகம, நாகொட, இமதுவ மற்றும் வத்தேகம.
The setup has informed the general public that it will operate with caution in relation to explosions that can occur on land, land subsidence, electric lines with a game, trees and building walls, and explosions that can occur on them.
In the event that such indicators are found, the national research organization has announced that it will evacuate the areas from which they originated.
Scientists are puzzled about the great planet's orbit around a very small star 
The planet that is like Thursday, which is called a red dwarf, is a very small star that orbits around a very large star, which is 30 light years away from the Earth. Scientists were surprised after discovering a solar family in this distance, which challenges the current understanding of the formation of the planet. 
Translation: On September 26, 2019, the largest exoplanet, Red Dwarf-TRAPPIST-1, was discovered orbiting the largest gas giant, JG 3512b, in a work of art.
The stars, in general, surround themselves with the largest planets, which are even larger than the largest stars. 
But in this event, the stars and planets do not have a significant difference in scale, say researchers. 
The star that is referred to as Jijey 3512 is 12% of the size of our sun. At the same time, the mass of the planet that orbits around it is less than half of the mass of Jupiter, which is the largest planet in our solar system. 
The Spanish space research institution, which led the research published in a scientific journal, has a space research institute in Spain, and the astrophysicist Carlos Morales, who is at the institute, said, "This is a completely surprising thing."
The discovery has caused astonishment, as the theory-building models usually assume that small planets like Earth and small Neptunes, which have a relatively small mass, would be found to have small moons, but this discovery contradicts that assumption. 
Morse said, "We have found that a great planet, which is like Thursday, is surrounded by a small star."
The planet, which is similar to Jupiter and was formed in large quantities by gases, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory in Spain. 
That is following its own orbit for 204 days, its elliptical path. 
The red dwarfs are small and have a low surface temperature. 
The sun of our country is not only smaller than the sun, but also about 35% larger than Jupiter, and it is comparable to a very large planet.
These celestial bodies will reveal their limited power, and compared to the sun, they will be dimmer, and their surface temperature will be around 3800 (Kelvin) degrees, which is relatively cool, about 6,380 degrees Fahrenheit or 3,527 degrees Celsius. 
Mores said, "It is because of this reason that they have the color of gold." 
The third planet from the Sun, which is the Earth, is in the state where the second planet, which is Venus, is orbiting around the Sun as a basis, and it is possible that the third planet has been ejected from the family of stars in the past, and this explains the elliptical orbit of the planet Venus, as mentioned by Morales.
The stars that surround them are formed in the same layer as the dust and gases that surround them.
The model of growth and development is called the "main sequence" model, which is considered as the primary model for the formation of stars. It is said that a substance begins to form from the solid particles in that layer, and the gravity of this star causes a gas atmosphere to emerge from the surrounding gas. 
This can be compared to a stateless gravitational force, like the pattern of this case, which can explain the unusual setup of this case.
Morse said, “In this event, the protoplanetary disk around that young star, which is surrounded by a gas giant, may be slightly larger and cooler than expected.” 
This is making the state of that layer unstable, and because of this, some dense areas may appear. 
The growth of a tree is not hindered by the branches that have fallen off, and as a result, a new tree is formed.
The High Court of the State has issued an order prohibiting the offering of goats and cocks as sacrifices in temples in Tirupur, which has caused a great controversy. 
In 1949, when Tripura merged with India, the State Government itself declared in the court that the promise given to Tripura was not fulfilled. 
Translation: Tripura, which was ruled by 184 kings for 1355 years, signed an agreement to merge with India on October 15, 1949.
The following dignitaries signed the agreement: 
The main aspect of that agreement is that the Tirupur Government will continue to provide financial assistance for the traditional worship practices of the 14 temples, including the famous Tirupur Sundari Temple, which are included in the agreement. 
The habit of offering goats as sacrifice at the temple of Tirupurushundari. 
The government is providing financial assistance for this. 
The connection with India cannot be changed as per the important clause of the agreement. 
The government, with the help of finance, dances against this, and it is said that sacrificing chickens is a way to appease the Hindu mind, according to Subhas Pattarji, who filed a public interest litigation in the Tripura High Court. 
The Division Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Karol and Arindam Lodha, while hearing this case, held that it is not permissible to sacrifice goats in religious places in Tripura.
The government cannot help in the sacrifice of animals such as goats and chickens, and the court has issued an order accordingly. 
The state chief secretary has instructed the district collectors, police superintendents, and judges to respond to this matter, and a notice has been sent to all of them by the court. 
The court has ordered that, except for the purpose of worship, animals should not be sacrificed in temples; and CCTV cameras should be installed in all temples to monitor them.
The state government is planning to file a petition against this order of the High Court in the Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court has informed that the state government has decided to file an appeal in the Supreme Court pointing out that the Tripura High Court has rejected their argument that they cannot go back on their promise given in 1949 when India merged with them. 
Youth who do not have a job can apply for unemployment allowance. 
Youths who have studied but do not have a job can apply for unemployment allowance, says Chennai district collector.
This is the news released by the District Collector Seethalakshmi on Wednesday: The Tamil Nadu government is providing assistance, job opportunities, and career guidance to young people who do not have employment through the "Mayyam" scheme, which guides them towards employment and profession.

The qualification for those who apply: Those who have been continuously enrolled for more than 5 years, have been maintaining and updating their records, and have been acting as a registered member.
The one who has reached the age of 40 should also be an Adi Dravida and a tribal person, and one who has not reached the age of 45 should not be. 
The applicants should be those who do not work in private institutions, and those who do not have self-employment opportunities. 
The manager of the company has accused the employee of stealing the company's property. 
The county sheriff's office in Marion County, Florida, is investigating allegations that a 38-year-old employee, Methina-Hernandez, had a sexual encounter with a co-worker, who is also a suspect in a separate case, at the office. 
The 38-year-old Kassandra Eni Methina-Hernandez, a citizen of Albania, was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute, both of which are B-felony charges. 
The event that occurred on September 9th at the gift shop in the Jefferson Mall caused the accusations to arise. 
A 27-year-old colleague of a suspect, who was questioned about the suspect's whereabouts at the time of the alleged crime, told county sheriff's office staff that the suspect had gone to the deli to buy lunch and had seen a person preparing a methamphetamine and heroin combination, and had eaten some of it, according to a statement obtained by OregonLive.com.
The person who was injured, when questioned by the investigators, said that he had never consumed anything intoxicating before, and that the taste of the few cigarettes he had smoked was different, but he didn't think about it, and that's what he said in his statement. 
The woman, after returning from work, had stomach pain and her legs were numb. 
When he went to the local hospital, it was decided that he might have been infected with penicillin-resistant methamphetamine, according to Alphenide Temekra-Herald.
The Smoking Gun News reported that Hernando, a colleague of Methina-Hernando, who was involved in the case of the person who was found to have put intoxicating substances in his food, said that Hernando told him that Methina-Hernando had said that he had put intoxicating substances in his food, at the same time, another colleague of Methina-Hernando, who was suspected of having put Methamphetamine in his bag, sent him a short message saying that Hernando had said that Methina-Hernando had said that he had put intoxicating substances in his food. 
The surveillance camera installed in the Delhi police station's control room, which was received from the Metina-Hernandez camera, has been turned around and taken something from its own place, and it has been reported that it went to the micro-wave and then sat down.
It is said that after he got up and stood, he wiped his nose, walked to a table, and put a small piece of paper with a pen on it. 
The things taken from his house were found in the bag, as if they had been taken from the bag, the police said. 
The reason why no one believes that the food served to any customer is tainted is because the authorities of the Sherif have said so, as reported by the Arkansas Statesman newspaper. 
The German national, Methina-Hernandez, is being held in Marian County Jail for $520,000 bail. 
The Smoking Gun is saying that he was punished for his past actions, including assault, harassment, theft, and possession of a banned weapon, and that he was also punished for having a banned weapon and for possessing a weapon that was used in a crime.

The secrets of the royal family: The frequent flyers on the royal plane will be surprised by the guests who are released
As part of their royal duty, members of the royal family should travel to numerous places around the world during their lifetime. 
This is a translation of a phrase used by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The phrase is: "वज्रपान" (Vajrapāna) which means "Royal Aerial" or "Aerial Gathering" and is derived from the Sanskrit words "Vajra" (meaning "thunderbolt") and "Pāna" (meaning "to go"). The phrase is often used to describe a gathering of important people, such as heads of state or dignitaries, who are brought together by the government for a specific purpose. In this context, the phrase is used to describe a gathering of the royal family and other important people from around the world, who are brought together by the government for a specific purpose, such as a summit or a ceremony. The phrase is often used to convey a sense of grandeur and importance, and is often used in official documents and speeches. வழக்கமாக இதை எளிதாக்குவது ராயல் விமானம் – முக்கியமா

It seems like, without the need to keep watch over long stretches of time and without the constraint of a limited number of seats, the royal family can invite anyone they want to, just like they would invite any unexpected guests, including some travelers.
According to the Channel 5 documentary that was broadcast recently, frequent flyers on Royal Airlines, Rani, Prince Philip, and others, are not available. 
On the occasion of the show 'Royal Air Secrets', the former pilot who operated the royal plane, along with his family and many animals, often came as guests.
Pope Shields said, “With some important members of the royal family and also with some important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also with our important royal dogs, who may occasionally accompany us as travelers, we may travel with our important family members and also
The queen, who was well-known for her deep affection for the Karakas breed of dogs, did not find it surprising when she called her beloved pets to accompany her on a journey.
The Queen Elizabeth has been in love with four-legged animals since her youth, and it is said that since she was crowned as Queen, she has kept over 30 Corgis as pets.

The employees of the royal airline will have no rest 
Before the dogs take off from the plane, the passengers' luggage is checked to see if there are any dogs inside and if they are allowed to be taken on board, said Shields.
I don't find joy in saying that there will never be any trouble. 
The scale of the shock caused by the actions of those who were known to have taken the reins of the kingdom during the time they were in the midst of their duties, was revealed in that incident.
According to the speaker of the event, "During his 44,000-mile Commonwealth tour in 1953, the Queen's possessions weighed 12 tons." 
If you imagine it, it is roughly equal to the weight of two large elephants. 
Even though there is no one who is drawn to clothes, the queen is not alone. 
It is said that the Cambridge girls took their modern dresses with them, each one having its own designated spot, as per the rumor that each dress had a designated spot for itself. 
The former MLA and parliamentarian Jack Edwards died at the age of 91. 
Jack Edwards, a 10-term American Representative who was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, passed away on a Wednesday. 
Edward Hopkins, who fought with tuberculosis, passed away at his home in Fairhope, Alabama, which was announced by his family through a news release.

He served in the parliament for 10 times. 
When asked what kind of world he would want to leave for his grandchildren, Edwards said that he would want them to inherit a world with good habits and customs, as reported by his family in their statement.

Michelle Obama's Instagram post says that a mentor is like a guiding stick 
The person on Thursday posted on his Instagram that "a great leader is one who has the ability to make a thought-provoking statement that can shake the foundations, and for that, he is changing our world in a remarkable way," and he highly praised it. 
Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the son and grandson of the British royal family, is traveling with his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to South Africa for an eight-day tour. Before embarking on the trip, the young couple and their son, Archie, attended a welcome event for young people and met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation. 
The leader who can unleash the power of thoughts that can shake the foundations, and who can make our world a better place, is indeed a great leader. Sussex Royal, the Duchess of Sussex, who has been praised by the former President's wife in her blog post for being a great leader, deserves our gratitude. 
Obama said that, regardless of whether it is a meeting with the leaders of our foundation or the education that women all over the world are seeking, he is a role model for many. 
For the British Vogue, Meghan Obama had an interview, the former "Suits" actress who was a guest editor for that issue. 
The former president's wife spoke about her mother-in-law and how she changed her in that candid conversation. 
According to the report, Obama said that being a mother is the greatest thing that has been allowed. 
My mother taught me that my work is to provide for those who are to be recognized and to give them the freedom to grow in the way they desire, in most cases. 
I do not wish them to be as I wish them to be, nor as I imagine them to be, but as they are, within themselves. 
The one who has experienced the difficulties of being a global leader like Obama, who has directly known the hardships of maintaining a home, gave some advice to the princess about household maintenance in an interview. 
He said, “You will feel a sense of pressure both within yourself and from others – it can be extremely overwhelming at times.” 
My greatest advice is to take a little time, don't be in a hurry, and don't rush into anything. 
In the white mansion, before taking on the great responsibilities, I used to worry about my daughters' excellent start in school and making new friends, and that's what occupied most of my time. 
It was like that – it is correct, and it is also good, as I think. 
The birthday celebration of Periyar, the 141st birthday, took place on 17.9.2019 from 6 pm to 8 pm at Hunter's Island in Virginia, USA.
The film "Periyar" was screened in the evening and it was a discussion on "Periyar's Eulogy of Feminism" 
The General Secretary of the Central Committee, Mr. Durai. 
The leader of the moon-god, Chandrasekaran, brought about a harmonious unity. 
Various thoughts were presented on the issue of women's rights.
The women's rights that Periyar wished to see are being realized here. 
The current situation is that women cannot become leaders. 
The leader who deserves to be respected in all aspects is Periyar.
In the Indian Parliament, there is no opposition.
What is the example that my opinion says no to giving a share to one-third of women?
The women's rights and the thoughts related to it, education, job opportunities, and caste elimination, are all remembered with great pride as Periyar's contributions.
The thoughts of the engineers, Mary, Aruna, Priya, Rashida, Sophia, Joel, Kalaiselvi, Ezhilvadan, and Arivupponi were gathered. 
The countries, continents, and the world have crossed and are living; even in the hearts of the descendants, the memory of Periyar is cherished with gratitude; this event has become a special one.

The journalist who met with him at the airport, after the meeting, said, "The DMK and Congress cadres from the Anna Nagar constituency have expressed their willingness to contest the election. 
Some people said they would submit their application as an individual. 
They may have spoken of it in one of their enthusiasm. 
Even if someone has a sense of self-importance, they will not be able to compete. 
All will act together. 
The central government cannot implement any project in the Kanyakumari district under the Sagarmala scheme. 
The environment and natural resources in the smallest district of Kumari district, which is in the area of the smallest district, should be protected. 
Because, building a new port in Kumari for the sea is not feasible for practical purposes. 
The complaint regarding the hotel's management is being heard, but the Trump hotel's liquor license is being held. 
The Washington (DC) – International Hotel Association, the owner of the Trump International Hotel, has been ordered by the Washington State Liquor Control Board to re-examine its liquor license due to the owner's behavior.
The majority of the three ministers, two judges and two deputy judges residing in or owning property in this district are not present, therefore the complaint given by them was dismissed by the organization on Wednesday. 
The Washington Post reports that this is the second time that applicants for liquor licenses are being told that they must have "good behavior" and that the state law allows the cancellation of the hotel's liquor license if they do not have it. 
The allegations of assault and corruption methods mentioned, it is said that President Donald Trump has been accused of violating the law, as stated in the initial complaint filed during the previous summer.
The permission had already been granted, so it was rejected. 
The second complaint was filed after the previous permission was renewed. 
Translation: In private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu, the reserved seats for foreign-born Indian students, which numbered 207, remain unfilled. As a result, these seats have been converted into administrative seats for the colleges concerned. 
The person who was a member of the Kovai group, which was filled with the spirit of righteous men through the proper investigation of these places, was a litigant in the Chennai High Court. 
The case has been referred to the judges, comprising Kripakaran and Vel Murugan, for re-examination. 
When that time comes, the lawyer who is a member of the Indian Medical Council, will submit a list to the vacant positions at a ratio of 10 students for one seat after the three-tier review process.
But, it is not clear whether it is filled based on that list 
The Tamil Nadu government has been instructed by the court to fill the reserved seats for Indians living abroad in a timely manner.
The lawyer who was sitting in the defendant's seat, accused, "The 207 places with low scores have been sold at a higher price to those who scored less."
The report is being investigated by the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) and it is a serious case. 
The police department that is corrupt is considered as the worst police department by the researchers. 
The Cleveland Police Department has been found to be incompetent in all matters, according to a report. 
The Cleveland Police Department's Homeland Security Consultant, Phil Comley, said that the city has been severely impacted. 
This translation is not perfect, but I'll try my best to translate it to English:
The report states that such efforts, including preventing crimes, arresting suspicious individuals, and protecting those who may be harmed, are likely to fail. 
After our previous research, there is a notable phenomenon,” said Dr. Phil Komley, a researcher at the University of HM.
The chief guardian of the first line, although he was described as "thorough" in his conduct, faced accusations that were not publicly known when he retired in January after serving for a year. 
The police officer who was arrested on suspicion of very bad behavior, followed by the dismissal of the leader of the aid, Adrian Roberts. 
The person who was responsible for the group's improper behavior last year, Simon Harwood, and his colleagues, were summoned before the group for their improper behavior.
He came out of his army. 
According to Mayor Ben Houssen of the City of Tea's Valley: "This is the proof that this army has been disbanded."
The time has come for the Ministry of Home Affairs to take charge. 
Richard Louis, the Chief of Staff: "The progress has been made, and I take full responsibility to lead the change," he said. 
The title of the book is "Boccherini" by William Par, who has left the post, without any inquiry or investigation into the circumstances of his departure. 
We don't know where we are going next. 
I think we are now stuck in a situation where we are hiding the truth, and I think it will take some time to investigate it. 
The person said, “They will do the work that has been assigned to them, following the time spent in discovering the truths, both the truths themselves and the time spent in discovering that truth, and the work that has been assigned to them.” 
This week, a letter from the White House, released this week, showed that Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he would investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the 2020 presidential candidates, and Biden's son. 
The written record of the phone call showed that Trump told Sessions to work with the lawyers, including his own personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, to handle the matter in this regard.
Trump denied that he had done anything wrong. 
The US Department of Justice informed the national security lawyers of the country before revealing the secret information about Trump's actions related to Ukraine, which was revealed by the whistleblower who exposed Trump's actions before the investigation was launched. 
The investigation unit of the intelligence agency received the recommendation from the authorities after taking the complaint, and after that, it was decided by the court that there is no need to investigate the criminal case related to the phone call made by Trump's phone number. 
The police investigation team has decided to summon a witness, and after questioning, they will decide whether to call the witness as a witness or not, and if so, who it will be, the prosecutor said. 
But he said, “I don’t believe it’s just a joke, it’s a plot to ruin me” 
He has been like that for a long time now. 
Donald Trump said that the reason for this is that he has been mentioned in all these (par) in his conversation with the Ukrainian President in July, referring to his Attorney General.
The decision of what to do with that complaint is still pending and is being considered with interest. 
The information about the person who revealed the secret is that he said "I am very worried" and that Trump accused them of being spies, saying that at that time, the spies were handled in a different way. 
The words of the leader are a lack of responsibility, and I think it is dangerous. 
The quote is from a speech by Palaniappan Chidambaram, the former Home Minister of India, where he says that those who reveal secrets are important for the government, but the government should not reveal information about those who provide such secrets. The full quote is: "Those who reveal secrets have a major role to play in our government," he said, "but those who reveal secrets should not be told about the people who provided them, as this would undermine the government's integrity." 
The historic investigation into the allegations of exerting pressure on a foreign leader to gain political advantage, which was announced on Tuesday, has been taken up by Belo.

The White House lawyers told the high-ranking officials that the computer in the Cabinet Office, which stores written records of telephone calls, should be cleared of any records related to the confidential information, and that the confidential information should be stored in a separate system, and the person who leaked the confidential information was charged with a crime.
Christian Pentecost: Crystal Palace striker, due to his speed, blocks the way of the vehicle 
He is facing the possibility of driving the Premier League's most popular car, Christiano Ronaldo's Bentley, after winning the Premier League twice in two months, twice as fast as before, due to being caught twice. 
On January 20, at 3-3 in the south-west of London, where the speed limit is 50 miles per hour, Crystal Bales, a 28-year-old striker, drove his Bentley at a speed of 80 miles per hour. 
The person from Belgium, after that, in March, in the south-west of London, at Putney, he had to go 40 miles per hour, but he actually went 89 miles per hour, which was recorded by a speed camera.

The group's organization is being discussed in a meeting by Coffeeman, who is expressing concern about it. 
The upcoming FIFA World Cup election committee structure has been revealed by Mr. Cofi Manou, a football administrator and second vice-president of the Football Association. 
The group's leader, Mr. Frank Davis, asked a question about his being included and said that he did not feel happy about being included. 
The group leader expressed doubt that the group's chairman would act fairly, citing the possibility that the group's chairman might gain an advantage from the investigation's findings, which were given to him in a meeting related to the GNA sports event.
The research committee should consist of individuals who are neutral and have no prior gain, and who do not have any connection with any of the members.
For example, with regard to the 10% commission related to the sale of Palm oil by Mr. Oyewale, Mr. Davis was appointed as the lawyer to draft the agreement. 
He is a well-known Olympic supporter. 
Because he has a benefit, he cannot be allowed to continue on the research committee for these two reasons. 
Translation: Mr. Manu, the director of the Olympics, said that if Mr. Fred Pappo, who is one of the directors of the group, appears before the group, a contradiction will arise due to his connection with the group. He also advised that if Mr. Palmer appears before the group, there will be prejudice and bias. 
The ceremony was held on September 19, Thursday, at the GFA office in Akra, and after taking office, the group members have started work from yesterday and are expected to complete it by October 4. 
The group's leader is Mr. Frank Davis, and also a corporate governance advisor and lawyer, Mrs. Maria Barnard, and Emmanuel Tharavu, who are all members. 
The founders of the company are Mr. Reginald Larry and Mr. Richard Abogado, a lawyer and a sports administrator respectively, and other members. 
Rupa Gurunath has been elected as the president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, and it is said that the DMK former minister's son also made an effort for that position. 
The Indian Cricket Board and State Cricket Associations are implementing various reforms as per the recommendations of the Lodha Committee. 
The rules of the cricket clubs are that one cannot continue to hold a position for more than 2 times, and people above the age of 70 cannot hold a position, and such things are the recommendations of the Lodha Committee. 
According to that, in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, those who were already in office could not continue in office. 
The situation required selecting new people. 
The former minister of DMK, Ponmudi's son Asok Sighamani has been elected as the president of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but India Cements' Srinivasan has blocked his attempt. 
As a result, without any other option, Acharya Sriman Sankara took up the responsibility of the leader. 
In Chennai, K.K. Nagar, this person is running a children's hospital, and he is the youngest son of a goldsmith. 
Asok Sighamani, who had an unrelenting passion for cricket from his school days, 
He was fully involved in the efforts of the Indian team at a particular stage. 
The current Tamil Nadu Cricket Association election, where the President and officials were elected without a contest, was caused by India Cements' Srinivasan. 
If Asoka Sivamani, the son of the great leader, Pon Mudaliyar, and the daughter of Seeni Vasagan, Rupa, had taken part in a competition, he would have taken the position of the leader and given a trophy to Rupa.
Asok Sighmani can be the vice president of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, and after the agreement reached by Sivanasan's side, he kept his calm. 
The case is seeking to hand over the Tamil inscriptions found in the epigraphy department of Mysore to the Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department. 
The Central Archaeological Department has taken steps to conserve and restore the sculptures taken from 27 ancient inscriptions in Tamil Nadu, and has issued an order to Chennai High Court, Madurai Bench, to take necessary action.
The manu (inscribed stone) of Maanu, who was from Madurai, was installed by Maanu, a Maanu, in the state of Karnataka, under the supervision of the Central Archaeological Department, at Mysore.
The ancient inscriptions and historical monuments in India are being preserved.
The Tamil inscriptions in this collection are the foundation for scientifically verifying the history of the Tamils. 
The additional, Tamil inscriptions in the Tamil Nadu region (taken by the Archaeological Department) are preserved. 
In this situation, when the office of the epigraphy department in Mysore, which was previously located in an old building, was shifted to a new building, most of the ancient Tamil inscriptions on the walls of the old building were damaged. 
The inscriptions at that place, the historical records, must be preserved in an orderly manner, published in book form, and digitized and maintained in electronic format.
However, the documents related to Tamil Nadu, which were kept in Mysore, were not properly preserved.
This is because the history, tradition, and culture of the Tamils will be lost to the future generations without knowing it. 
Therefore, it was decided to hand over the Tamil inscriptions found in the epigraphy department of the Mysore Archaeological Department to the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. 
The asceticism of Sivagnanam, R. Dharani, and others, who are in the state of being, has come to an end. 
When the judges, taking cue from the ancient inscriptions of Tamil Nadu, decided to protect and preserve the ancient symbols, the Central Department of Archaeology intervened and stayed the proceedings, directing that the case be adjourned until October 22nd. 
The request for a ticket for the match against Australia 
Justin Langer says that the time to show talent has come in the match against Australia, where the Australian team can determine the destiny of the Welsh team in the World Cup. 
The Australian team's victory over their opponent, which has the highest chance of winning the match in the group stage, will confirm the possibility of meeting France or Argentina in the quarterfinals.
But if Australia beats Wales for the 14th time in their last 15 meetings, it will push England to the last eight places and they will have to meet Australia in the last eight.
The Wales team's reserve player, Dibble, said, "There is nothing to hide, both teams won, and we are trying to take the top spot in the group." 
The decisions made in the past were difficult, but in the winter of their life, they got a sweet victory against Australia. 
I think they will have a thorough plan to defeat us again, and at the same time, we want to ensure that we will win again.
Before it even arrives, it is clear to us that this will be a crucial competition. 
We have arrived here now, in truth, the time has come to show our abilities.
The Welsh team has won only one victory against Australian, New Zealand or South African teams in the history of the world cup – it was in the third place play-off match 32 years ago when they beat the Australians. 
The overall leader of the training, Kentland, under whose guidance three South Korean basketball players, including Jambavan, faced 41 challenges against their opponents, managed to win only 7 victories out of them. 
Wales ended a 13-match losing streak against Australia in November, and that 9-6 win still resonates, and one of the players who will be joining the team for the match at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday. 
Before that victory, when I asked whether anything had been blocked in the mind, he said, "It's hard to say." 
The competitions were extremely difficult, perhaps it was a mental block that made people think it was impossible, I don't know.
We were almost 15 points behind in the previous match, and when we look at the points now, it seems even harder than it actually was. 
If Wales wants to win, Australia's famous second-tier players Michael Hooper and David Pocock with the direction of the coach will be crucial. 
The 67th time the referee has awarded a penalty, these two players have played against each other in many previous matches, so he will know exactly what will happen next. 
The seven of them were entirely world-renowned heroes, he said. 
The great line of the world will be difficult to cross when it clashes with brave warriors at any time. 
They are the greatest heroes in the world, one after the other. 
It is known to you what kind of competition you are going to face. 
The greatest warriors in the world are those who protect the bond, Michael is almost like a rugby player who can tackle anyone who comes his way, he knows the right time and place to be in rugby. 
The one who does not play fairly should not fight with heroes, but rather fight with the greatest heroes in the world and challenge yourself. 
You want to play against the best warriors, and when you play against these two warriors, you must be at your best with your skills.
I won't say it's the final match, but for us, this is the most important match in the world cup. 
The spirit of the team is an important part of it. 
If you continue to play well and express your excellent performance, it will be difficult for others to beat you. 
The danger of Chennai's sea level rising
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that the four Indian coastal cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat, and Chennai are at risk of being submerged due to the rising sea level, which has increased by 27 cm. 
The research team of the Institute of Oceanography, which conducted a study on the changes in oceanic conditions in response to climate change, has published its research report. 
At the end of this century, the Himalayas will rapidly melt and the sea level will increase significantly. 
Translation: As a result, there is a great danger of the sea flooding the cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat, and Chennai, which are all located in the coastal areas of India. 
At the same time, many parts of North India are facing a severe water scarcity. 
The situation is developing rapidly, much faster than before. 
As a result, by the year 2100, 1.4 billion people worldwide will be affected.
There are 4 coastal cities in India, but globally, there are 45 port cities, 50 cm, above sea level, which are in danger of being submerged in water. 
Every year, the situation of danger increases, and the low-lying coastal areas, small islands are in a bad situation of danger.
If immediate action is not taken to reduce global warming, the temperature of the ocean will increase, and the marine life will be in a state of extinction. 
The world's resources will be depleted. 
In a large measure, there is a possibility of storms and troubles. 
The sea temperature has increased by two times from 1982 to 2016. 
The investigation report is noted as such in this document.
The Estimators: After the shock of the wind, Ben calls out to the calm. 
The shock of the wedding of Vinny Dean (Shona McGarty) will send shockwaves, as she gets married to her love interest, and this will cause a stir between Kallum Hayes (Tony Clay) and Ben Mitchell, who will be left reeling. 
But will they be in a state of friendship, or in a state of anger, about this matter, or will both of them be distressed? 
The story of Pennin's life was that he was helped by Kallam, who was a wise and kind person, and who helped him to overcome his difficulties, and also helped him to understand the situation, and with the help of Kallam, he was able to understand the situation and make a decision. And it was said that Kallam was very pleased with Pennin's decision, and that Pennin was very grateful to Kallam for his help. 
When he left without saying goodbye, I was left with a feeling of disappointment, but now he's coming back with a more elevated mood, having spent time in solitude and reflection, and I'm looking forward to seeing him with a renewed sense of purpose and energy. 
The person who is eligible to get married and is going to become someone's husband, having realized that he had deceived himself after knowing that he had been deceived, it is clear that he received the greatest reward for his deception from the fortress he left behind. 
When he comes to his home, his mind is united with his feet.
But soon, he will reveal one truth that will make him stop. 
Jamie Mitchell (Jamie Barthwick) is worried because he saw the Queen of England drinking again after having a bad day, walking down the street, because of which she will have to start drinking again. 
Translation: Having drunk, he went to Kal Penn's place in a state of consciousness, and fought with all the things that had happened to him on Kal Penn's head.
The one who has been patient, accepting the fact that the time has come, is pleased with him, because they had already decided long ago, so the fear of time, which cannot be controlled, becomes a feeling of surrender. 
But what will they aim at after that?
The next week, that couple will try to go dating, but the intense thinking about their previous relationships, that couple will try to do everything to ruin it. 
But after proving himself to his homophobic father, he gained a new self-confidence, and he decided to fight for what he considered to be his rightful thing.
The memento will be shown on BBC One's EastEnders at 8.30pm on September 27. 
The sorrow of knowing the reason for the fall from office is like the whole world is in sorrow
The authorities of the White House have decided to counter the efforts of the Democratic Party, which has renewed its efforts to solve the new problem, but without a solution, the situation has been in a state of panic for a week now. 
The person who revealed the secret may be accused by the authorities and those around them, and as a result, it may seem like the Western region is experiencing increased anxiety, fear, and worry, like a storm cloud looming over the White House. 
There is nothing there, it cannot be believed that there is nothing there, the situation is like that, said that person. 
The person in question is in a state of uncertainty about what to do, and as there is no clear plan for the situation, they are unable to escape the controversies, and it seems that the President's usual methods of getting out of trouble are not applicable in this case, and the person in question has expressed this by saying that "it's not like something that can be hidden away until the next news comes along." 
Another person who is aware of these recommendations, a member of the White House, said that they are in a state of great shock, and that if this position is taken away from them, they will be in a state where they cannot control themselves, and the possibility of them being in a state where they cannot control themselves increases, and they are worried that it will become even more so. 
The situation where the Chief Minister is under pressure to take a decision every day during the inquiry into the corruption case, and some people around him are worried that he may become emotional and take a rash decision, and another person also expressed the same concern, is a worrying situation. 
It is causing anxiety that it is not possible to calculate the behavior of Trump further, and it may take unexpected forms of retaliation, and this is causing concern in both the presidential and political spheres during the election year.
Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling found that Trump had shifted from a defensive posture to a more proactive one, taking steps to counter the threat. 
The actions of the leaders of the ruling party and the presidential candidate Joe Biden and their associates, who had revealed the secrets, were turned into attention, and by causing the doubts to collapse, they sought to help their political opponents in Ukraine to investigate their political opponents by using the secrets they had revealed. 
But in the white mansion, where many are enjoying the experience of Mullai Pulanai, it has been said by the assistants and advisors that in this way, they have started to experience it in a different way. 
In a situation where the name 'Adhipar' is considered to be powerful, the editor of a newspaper who was defeated in the meeting said that this situation is like a person who has lost his shape.
The Trump who was delighted by the questions related to Russian investigation and did not respond to the questions related to Ukraine, seemed to be in a state of denial.
The phone call related to the problem between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which some people claimed to have known directly, was not true, and this is said to undermine his credibility, and some of his colleagues believe that this can be mitigated. 
The truth that the Governor has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded by the truth that he has been surrounded
But one who is a close acquaintance of the white palace, the high-ranking officer, said that the recognition points of the superior officer are already very high and that it is difficult for new people to get recognition for promotion. 
The attention paid to the issue of the Speaker's post in the next four months will not yield any benefit, especially if it leads to the disruption of the Assembly's proceedings and becomes a headline-making news item. 
The people who say that the position of the leader can be helped by removing him, do not know what his answer will be, according to the other side. 
The worried white-robed officials, who are concerned about the loss of their position, are seeking the advice of counselors to find out how to take revenge. 
The person who talked about the plans said that, as the efforts are still in the initial stage, it is unclear whether the efforts will bear fruit like a battle or in what form they will be, and that it is still unclear. 
The person who clearly understands this, has revealed the secret, and the person who has revealed the secret has a report that will expose the people's support for the opposition, which is against the public release of the report, and the person who has revealed the secret is trying to take away the position of the ruling party, and the person is saying that it is necessary to have a report that is a combination of legal and information technology, as a confirmation that the person has said that it is necessary to have a report that is a combination of legal and information technology. 
The Foreign Ministry officials, including Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, have stated that they will not release the transcript of the call between the Ukrainian President and Trump, except for the fact that they have spent 48 hours discussing the matter, and there is no other way to release it, as there is no long-term strategy. It was a situation that showed that there was no strategy, as it was said that there was no other way to release it, except for the fact that they had spent 48 hours discussing the matter. 
The investigation into Robert Mueller's charges will be more intense now than it was during the time it was happening. It is expected that the person who will be responsible for creating a response to the impeachment proceedings will be a person who is closely related to Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as mentioned in this. 
But for that one effort, which is said to have been made by the leadership to take responsibility, it is not true, according to the news agency, NBC, reported Levandovski. 
He said that for the past five years, he had done everything he could do, but he did not consult with the chairman about joining a team to prevent the misuse of power, which is similar to a position of authority.
From Mullar's investigation, Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the efforts to prevent the impeachment, 
When Sekulo was interviewed by NDTV regarding his thoughts on the matter, he said, "We will handle the issues properly when the time is right." 
When Clinton stepped down from office, Muller's investigation continued until its conclusion, and Emmet Flood, who had guided the investigation as a lawyer, left his position. Since the current legal advisor of the White House did not have such an experience, a lawyer with experience in investigations is currently not present in the White House. 
A person who has insight into the strategy of the White House has said that there are no authorities who can bring together all the people or set up war rooms, but he agrees that one person who can bring together all the people and lead a political struggle is necessary.
The meteorological department has issued a weather bulletin today stating that it is possible for heavy rain to occur in most parts of the country in the evening, as per the atmospheric pressure system. 
In most parts of the country, it may rain heavily in the evening or at night, accompanied by thunderstorms. 
Heavy rainfall of up to 75 mm is possible in some places in the districts of Sabaragamuwa, Central and Uva. 
In the Eastern province, it may rain a little in the morning beyond the coastal area. 
The Royal Caribbean Explorer of the Seas cruise ship's £89 million refit has been unveiled. 
The Royal Caribbean International family's explorer of the seas, is embarking on a new journey this summer with a fresh new look. 
The ship, after being refurbished for $110 million (£89 million), now has all the family's entertainment needs, including global food buffets, within itself. 
The explorer ship will be stationed at some of the best ports in Italy and Greece this summer, providing passengers with a taste of the Mediterranean charm of Europe. 
Although there are no extraordinary things in the world, when the experiences that remain in the mind as a memory are compared to the vastness of the ocean, it is as if the ocean is providing the guarantee to deliver them.
The explorer's new $110m – or around £89,000,000 – renovation has turned this ship into something perfect for taking the family on a trip abroad. 
If the technology that captivates the mind is a modern surfing simulator with the help of a navigator, then it is possible to sail on the internet or experience the weather on the outside screen while watching a movie that the family has captured.
Translation: However, it is undeniable that this combination has a very modern aspect, which is the true essence of a panoramic view, allowing passengers in the inner rooms to see the sea views from within, without having to step outside. 
For those who wish to stay in the water, a pool with a Caribbean vacation atmosphere, complete with water slides, is available. 
The island's villas and daytime beds, surrounded by the sea, are suitable for relaxation in the sunlight, and at the same time, there are two modern water sports facilities for the thrill-seekers on the ship. 
This sentence translates to: 
The opportunity to create a childhood adventure for younger siblings, while providing games and music sections for teenagers above 12 years old. 
If that is not enough, the whole family can join the game of roulette with God's guidance in the "Studio B" of the ship, and that place is also used as a skating rink.
The opportunity to discover the delicious foods of the world, which are spread out like a canvas on the ship, when traveling in the middle of the ocean, is available to guests.
The latest Asian food varieties are available in the ship's dining hall, and by eating the traditional Italian food in the new Italian restaurant of Giavanni, one can enjoy the most delicious food in a normal setting. 
The restaurants on the ship include American Steakhouse, Poleros Latin Bar, Scunner Bar, and Johnny Rockets Express. 
The cruise ship with the itinerary of seven nights and nine days, accompanied by choices, will set sail from Rome city in May 2020.
The Royal Caribbean's second European ship, which recently underwent a major renovation to accommodate the Alcove of the Sea, is now ready to set sail. 
The total cost of $165 million was incurred over 58 days of preparation, and as a bonus, a value of $300 was given to registered guests who had registered in advance. 
The cruise ship operator announced that the fourth ship in the series of modernized Royal Caribbean Amphibious ships, which has undergone a transformation in the Voyager class, is named "Explorer of the Seas".
The project, which has invested over $1 billion in 10 ships over the past 4 years, offers an unparalleled experience for guests, with every aspect of the experience, including unique and unexplored elements such as thrilling adventures and culinary delights, as well as a luxurious overnight stay. 
The Trump administration's propaganda films are accusing the Democratic News party of committing a crime because they heard it for the sake of the news of the day.
It is clear that Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a member of the House of Representatives, cannot “stand” the investigation into Donald Trump. 
The leader accused the members of the democratic party of trying to obtain the confidential documents of the government for the purpose of protecting the leader on Thursday. 
The head of the parliamentary committee of inquiry, Newson, who is the leader of the Janata Party, accused Trump of not providing assistance to investigate the allegations against Joe Biden and his son, which was revealed in a secret report. 
The American senator who had earlier said that the Democratic Party members and the leftists wanted to see the smoke-free pictures of the President's non-existent photos, now said that Ukraine's corruption was created by the leftists and their "media assets". 
The news is that the leaders of this group, who are from Ukraine and are part of the democratic party, had a meeting with people who thought that the people from Ukraine were Trump's supporters. 
The people can ask why they are removing the chairman from his position, when they are in a situation where they have only one chance to get an opportunity in the next year, and the chairman is being removed from his position in a situation where they have only one chance to get an opportunity in the next year, and the chairman is being removed from his position in a situation where they have only one chance to get an opportunity in the next year.
News that its report is finished, after that, the senior political reporter of the Washington Post, Jennifer Bentery, decided to investigate whether the leaders of the ruling party want to know the depth of this matter or not. 
Until now, only Connecticut Representative Jim Himes (D) has responded, but we suspect that his colleagues will also believe his words are true.
Mediaite.com suspects that the news "thoughts about the preference for clothing that are controversial steel documents that can be found in steel documents that contain information that is not confirmed and additional information that is not confirmed" refers to "lustful and unconfirmed additional information". 
This text translates to: 
The student who was arrested in the cheating case in the election has been taken into custody by the police, and the Dean of the Medical College, Dr. Rajendran, has given a statement to the CPI (M) police, which has caused a stir. 
The person who is related to Chennai's Thandaiyar Pettai is Dr. Venkatesan. 
He is a doctor at Stanley Medical College Hospital in Chennai. 
The son of this person, Udith Surya, has been accused of manipulating the results of the election and committing a crime. 
After the investigation that followed, the student Udit Surya and his father Dr. Venkatesan were arrested by the CBI police. 
The investigation conducted by them revealed that Vengatesan, the father of the student who emerged, had given Rs. 20 lakhs of money to another student and had written a letter of recommendation to get him admitted to the medical college, and it has been found out through the investigation that he had committed a crime. 
After this, Surya and his father were arrested and put in prison. 
In this situation, the DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police) of Chennai, the Vice-Chancellor of the Medical College, and the Chief of the Police Intelligence Department, met with Dr. Rajendiran before investigating the case, specifically before questioning Uththira Surya. 
When he gave the explanation at that time, it was found that there was a difference between the explanation given by Suriya, who had given a statement to the police, and the statement given by Suriya to the police.
The person who is in the hall during the student's admission process at Rajendiran's hospital college, as explained by the principal of the hospital college, is the one who participated. 
It is said that the student was admitted based on that foundation. 
The person who wrote this note, who is also a student and a participant in the meeting, and who has only been a student in the college for a short time, was told by the college principal that he was only a participant in the meeting and was not a student in the college.
However, the one who has taken the oath given by the Sun God at the source of the river and has joined the assembly of students, has directly participated in it, as revealed by him. 
What kind of person takes a photo of someone who has been caught in the act and puts it in a folder at the Udit Chandra College?
What did I miss when I was busy with the school and student union activities?
The questions that were asked have risen 
The investigation has found that a student who had uploaded his own photograph along with his bio-data at the time of admission to the medical college is now under scrutiny.
The photograph in it is the same as the photograph in the hall ticket.
The student, along with the faculty of the Surya Medical College and Hospital, handed over the voting slip to the Director of SPCI, Dr. Rajendran, the Principal of the Medical College, along with the letter from the Governor of Tamil Nadu. 
The police have started an investigation into the matter with high-ranking officers. 
The conclusions of this will be revealed when the mysteries within it are cleared up. 
Who is connected to whom and what is the relationship between them will be known. 
The Central Government should not be obeyed, said Sarath Pavara, who had earlier said that he would surrender before the court on the next day in the case of misappropriation of cooperative bank funds, in a press conference held in a commotion. 
The losses incurred by the state treasury due to the irregularities that occurred in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank in the year 2007-08 amount to Rs. 25 billion. 
The reasons for this loss include the sugar factory and the dyeing and bleaching factories, which were established in violation of the rules, and the loans provided to these factories, which are included among the causes. 
In connection with the irregularities of this manner, the Mumbai High Court's order led to the Mumbai police registering a case against 71 people, including Ajit Pawar, a senior leader of the Nationalist Congress Party and former Deputy Chief Minister, last month. 
In this, there are political leaders, former bank officials, and high-ranking officials. 
The police have registered a case against Ajith Pavaar and Sarath Pavaar, the leader of the National Congress, based on the previous case registered by the police, which was a sudden turn of events in this case.
The late Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, was also a Union Minister in the government led by the Congress party. 
The law enforcement agency has taken action which has led to a stir in the state ahead of the election on October 21, the next month, to the Maratha legislature. 
In this situation, the national leader of the Congress party, Sarath Pawar, spoke to the investigators. 
I am not a member of the association related to the case, nor am I a witness in the place where the case is to be concluded, but I have been included in this case by the department of prosecution.
What I am doing in this action is nothing that I should be surprised by. 
I will mostly be in Mumbai for the parliamentary election campaign. 
Therefore, the law enforcement agency cannot consider me as a fugitive. 
I am going to the office of the department of public works (or public works department) to file a complaint (or to complain) about the road works (or road construction) on the day of the full moon. 
I will provide them with the information they desire. 
The investigation of the case is their right. 
I trust the Constitution.
I will give full cooperation to the investigation. 
The philosophy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is being followed in Maharashtra.
We do not know how to bow our heads before the great Delhi 
The Maratha first-minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the allegation that political interference is involved in this matter. 
This is what he said about this:
The police registered a case, and the court issued an order. When the crime amounting to Rs. 100 crores occurred, the investigation department will investigate the case. 
The case is being taken up by the enforcement agency in that manner. 
This action was taken for political reasons and not as it is being said. 
Research on renewable energy resources that can be recycled can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In recent years, electric cars and Tesla semi-trucks have been leading the headlines, but it seems like they are just hovering around the boundary of renewable energy, unable to take off. 
But an alumnus of the University of Alberta, one professor has developed a technology that can convert biomass into aviation fuel. 
The professor, Dr. David Pressler, who is a professor of agriculture, life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta, started this project in 2003. 
The research laboratory is producing high-quality hydrocarbon fuel from lipids such as cooking oil, animal fats, and canola oil, and waste materials like used cooking oil, animal bones, and canola oil.
This technology allows the production of biofuels that are not based on petroleum, which can reduce carbon emissions by about 85% compared to traditional fossil fuels, and also enables the use of waste materials from other industries in the process, making it a more sustainable option. 
The technology is operating to extract the hydrocarbons present in petroleum-based fuels. 
The statement made by Presler is: “Our technology from the first generation onwards has been creating the same hydrocarbons, which are the building blocks of diesel, as molecules.” 
This is a new selection for the use of biofuel, which is in a state where it can provide a new choice, in a situation where previously created biofuel technologies are losing their stability at low temperatures, and it is causing a serious problem for the high-flying aircraft that requires a lot of fuel.
According to Pressler, it is a problem that cannot be bypassed, similar to the Checkmate-22 problem in the fuel of a plane.
The truth is that its value is less than diesel, but its necessity is greater. 
The Pressler Institute is currently focusing on two options to produce biofuel for aircraft. 
The first selection will have their hydrocarbon fuel converted to another refined product, hydrogen, by a safer approach. 
The second option, even in low temperatures, will keep the fuel in a stable state, having already partially formed in the chemical process. 
The second option is to play some games with the chemistry we have in our reactor, which is related to our second choice, and it is possible for us to do so, said Presler. 
There is much danger in it.
The organizations such as the airlines, Canada and the American military, which invest heavily in upgrading their selection for the purpose of being competitive, have caused the Alberta University subsidiary company, Forge Hydrocarbons, to operate commercially. 
He said that it is possible that someone in the future might impose a carbon tax on them. 
In that state, they are expecting a change.
The Forge is currently operating a test facility near the management center of Edmontontan's waste management, and with the launch of a $25 million production facility in Somerville, Ontario, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, the company has recently received a US$4 million investment from Lockhart Martin. 
Translation: 
Even if it is calculated that 85% of the carbon emissions will be reduced as planned, the factors that make carbon emissions not decrease significantly are the same as the factors that make production and consumption go up, and the President points out. 
A person who is related to one technology. 
According to Presler, the way to create options and make a decision is to create multiple possibilities and then choose one. 
The High Court has ordered an inquiry into the foundation laid by Dr. Seiku Shihabuddin Mohammad Shafi, a renowned gynecologist and pediatrician, on the basis of a petition filed by the owner of the hospital, regarding the foundation's right to the property, in connection with the property dispute between the hospital and the foundation. 
This petition will be taken up by the High Court on January 24th. 
The accused, who had been arrested under various charges including illegal confinement, arbitrary collection of money, and violation of medical ethics, had filed a writ petition before the court, challenging the detention by the investigating officer and the medical board, and seeking a direction to the authorities to take action against the accused in accordance with the law.
The Prime Minister, in the midst of a meeting with the British government, warned the people to be prepared for the possibility of Britain facing a situation like the Los Angeles riots if the Brexit negotiations fail, following the warning issued by Boris Johnson's coalition. 
A senior cabinet minister said last night that if the second vote changes the real decision, there is a risk of a "violent, people's uprising" in the country. 
The French protests over economic downturns, including the 1992 Los Angeles riots, are of a scale that the UK can no longer afford to ignore the internal instability. 
The Rev. Mr. John said that the intense quarrel in question should be settled through political language, saying “let anger subside” – but he refused to use the word “surrender” at any cost.
Even if they demand peace, a Cabinet Minister of Times magazine said: "We have not seen anything like the riots in this country, nor the struggles of Giles Johns [yellow shirt] or the Los Angeles uprising [1992] so far." 
This cannot happen because it has never happened before, and people do not think it is possible in this country. 
The current struggle of those people is like a model, modern mobile phones are also available to coordinate it, only two popular leaders are needed to motivate the people. 
The four white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black driver, in a case in Los Angeles in 1992, were acquitted by the court and this led to the Los Angeles riots.
The first day of this year, the bright yellow vests – worn by the French revolutionaries who opposed the government, led by Gilet Jacques, in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks, causing destruction and chaos. 
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it will lead to a great crisis in our political system, said Minister Johnson in the Lok Sabha.
“According to the minister, in the election where 30 million people participated, if 66% of us said we could have been together, then 10 million people are still unhappy.” 
Even if 99% of them are ridiculed, still 100,000 people are genuinely angry, and they will write to their parliamentary representative to stop it. 
There is nothing greater than this, soon countless people will be on the streets. 
If the result of the first election is changed by the second election, there is a danger that a "radical, enthusiastic" people will arise in the country, said a senior Cabinet Minister.
Translation: Mr. Johnson has called for a general election to be held in a way that the voters can resolve the prexit crisis.
It is said that he faced the minister's protest by signing an agreement with the European Union in place of his own demands, which he had reduced.
The life imprisonment of his brother who killed the social media celebrity of Pakistan, 'Gaurav', has been announced. 
It is not the case that justice is implemented with punishment most of the time, and in some cases, the accused murderers are released on bail and the cases are dismissed, as stated by female human rights experts.
Farsan Bari, a Pakistani woman who established the first gender studies department at a university in Pakistan, said, “As people take a long time to remember, even in a crucial case like this, it takes three years to get a verdict.” 
Although human rights groups claim that establishing credible information is difficult, Pakistan's Human Rights Commission reported at least 300 "honor killings" in 2018. 
Every year, the world is experiencing 5,000 honor killings, out of which one-fifth occurs in Pakistan, according to the honor-based violence awareness network, which estimates that the actual number is much higher than the reported number, say many lawyers. 
The prolonged drought has caused flooding and chaos in many parts of India 
The monsoon season in India has increased by almost a month, and the unprecedented rain has caused buildings to collapse, resulting in loss of life and many crops to wither away. 
The normal pattern is that in North India, the monsoon starts decreasing in September, but this month, the average rainfall has been 37% more than the normal pattern.
If this situation continues for a few more days, it is likely that the severe drought that has been ongoing for several decades will continue, according to the Indian Meteorological Department.
Translation: 
The water flooded the houses, and people waded through the streets, up to their waists, in the rain, and such scenes are usually seen only during the peak of the monsoon season.
Heavy rain fell in cities like Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad, and other places. 
The severe damage has occurred to the houses in the state of Uttarakhand located in the northern part of the country due to the continuous rain. 
This rain has started late in this season. 
In many places, water scarcity has occurred, and farmers have prepared for drought.
Farming people do not wish for this kind of prolonged drought season. 
It is not customary for this much rain to fall in this season of the year. 
This is my vegetable garden – it has peas, beans, potatoes, and tomatoes. 
The delay in starting, the continuous rain, and the high price of chilies, which is an essential item in Indian food, have caused a problem for consumers. 
The price of a kilogram of ginger is usually around 20 rupees (23 pounds) in places like Chennai, but in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, it is sold for around 80 rupees (approximately £1). 
There is danger lurking even in festivals. 
The next big festival is Dussehra on October 8th, when Hindus will celebrate with great pomp and gaiety, and Ravana's effigy will be set on fire.
The burning of Ravana is to indicate that goodness has triumphed over evil. 
But in this situation where the villains are made to act by paper (i.e., script), if the final scene comes, Ravana might win. 
The government hospital has a bus stand, free parking, public waiting area, and a public meeting ground for the parties of the government, and if it is used for various facilities, what kind of environment will it be? 
The state of Uthangarai Government Hospital in Krishnagiri district is that. 
This hospital is a government hospital where 1000 to 1200 patients receive treatment every day. 
There should not be excessive noise or pollution around hospitals; it is necessary to follow strict rules in places where hospitals are located. 
The situation is deplorable and deserving of pity, as those who surround it do not follow it and it is suffering due to the cruel government hospital.
The buses of the government as well as private ones are halted before the entrance of the hospital. 
The bus stops in front of the hospital entrance, even if it's close to the hospital. 
The noise of those buses is like a symphony.
The sound of the bus conductor's voice in a crowded bus is the sound of the world's chaos. 
The ambulances of the private organizations are taking shelter at the entrance of the government hospital.
The traffic congestion in front of the hospital is found at any time. 
Tamil Nadu is ready to face the north-east monsoon, says State Disaster Management Minister R. B. Udhayakumar, speaking in Tiruchy.
The Minister R. B. Udhayakumar, who had come to Tiruchirappalli for participating in various events, gave an interview to the journalists. 
The southwest monsoon, excluding Tamil Nadu, is being faced in other states. 
The Northeast monsoon in Tamil Nadu starts in October and lasts for three months. 
During this monsoon season, when the atmospheric pressure is low over the coastal area, there is a possibility that the cyclone may cross the coast. 
Tamil Nadu is ready to face the severe cyclone in the North-East monsoon this year, considering the damage caused by the cyclones of the past. 
4,393 locations have been found to be at risk of being affected by the danger.
In this, areas where water can stagnate up to 5 feet are extremely dangerous and have been listed.
There is a possibility of a cyclone affecting 12 coastal districts in the state. 
In this district, 121 special centers have been set up to keep the general public safe.
Except for this, in other districts, wedding halls, schools, and community centers are ready to be used. 
The amount of Rs. 148 crores has been allocated for relief works. 
The state rescue team is ready in these districts. 
The reason for the Tamil Nadu government's prompt action was that even a fisherman did not lose his life during the cyclone. 
The translation is: Instead of the wall collapsing and falling, and the electricity running and people dying, 
The necessary measures have been taken to prevent the similar kind of losses that occurred last year.
Translation: Stand firm with the tasks of redemption, and provide relief, and continue with the tasks of rebuilding and reconstruction.
According to this, the government has taken steps to provide compensation of Rs. 1.10 lakhs to 1.10 lakh people who have lost their homes in the districts of Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur affected by the cyclone Gaja. 
The minister Udhayakumar said it like this. 
The tank of Lord Murugan's temple is filled with water after a few days of heavy rain in Tiruttani.
The mountain path that leads to the Tiruttani Murugan temple, which is located in the part of the mountain where one has to climb up, has a Saravana Poigai lake. 
In this sacred tank, devotees bathe in the holy water, then walk along the mountain path, and worship the presiding deity.
This festival, apart from this, takes place every year on the occasion of the Ganesha festival, and for three days, a grand festival takes place in this temple. 
In this situation, at the time of the festival of Aadi Krithigai, which took place last month, due to the lack of water in the temple tank, the temple administration, with the cooperation of the devotees and volunteers, arranged for water to be brought to the temple using a tractor. 
The festival of the god of the sky has been celebrated. 
In this situation, for some days, the heavy rainfall that has been falling in Tiruttani city has filled the Saravana Poigai lake to the brim, and now the excess water is flowing out.
Four years later, it is now that Truk is fully supplied. 
The Collector of the district has announced that by selecting and cultivating the rapidly growing species of fish called Thilapia, the farmers can earn more profit. 
What he has written in his letter about this matter is as follows: 
The farmers who cultivate fish in ponds will get more profit if they choose the genetically modified tilapia fish which grows faster than other fish. 
The fish that are other than the carp, can be bred in a smaller area with a larger number, compared to the carp. 
This species has a strong resistance to disease and grows faster than other fish. 
The ones who consume more are fond of this type of fish. 
Because farmers are seeking to cultivate genetically modified fish in their ponds for greater benefits. 
The fish of the Dileepa lake, which are found near the Krishna Giri dam, are ready for sale throughout the year in the government fish farm. 
These can be purchased by farmers and grown for consumption.
The farmers who cultivate these fish shall establish a protective fence around their fish farm, no matter what the reason, and shall keep a watch on the nearby water bodies to prevent the fish from spreading.
The fishermen of Kanchipuram district, who have registered their fish farm at the development camp, should cultivate fish only in their own farms after that. 
The Marine Fisheries Department, Coastal Road, Neelangarai, Kanchipuram District, or contact the office directly at 044-24492719. 
The DNA testing agreement has been signed to test the human bone fragments found at the lower level.
Translation: The Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamraj University, and Harvard Medical School have jointly conducted a DNA analysis of the ancient human skeletons unearthed from the Keezhadi, Kondagai, and Adichchanallur archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu. 
The Director-General of the Archaeological Department and the Superintendent of Archaeological Survey, T. Udhayachandiran, said: 
Translation: 
We believe that in our future archaeological excavations at Konthagai, Keezhadi and Adichanallur, we will find a large number of ancient human bones. 
These examples will be sent to DNA research. 
The important thing that this reveals is what kind of genetic information was present in the human bones found in Tamil Nadu.
The ingestion of pesticides in excess of recommended levels can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
A new study suggests that working with high levels of pesticides can lead to heart disease in the future. 
Translated to English, this reads: "For more than three decades, the group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii was in this state."
When comparing people who work with pesticides with those who do not, researchers found that 45% of those who were heavily exposed had a higher risk of heart disease or stroke.
The importance of using personal protective equipment and recording pesticide exposure and common heart disease risk factors in medical records, which is emphasized by the study co-author, Dr. Peter Rodericks, is crucial during times when pesticides are used as a means of livelihood, such as when pesticides are used as a means of livelihood, and when pesticides are used as a means of livelihood. 
He is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii, which is in his mind. 
The findings in this paper are based on data from over 6,000 individuals who participated in the Quagmire Honalu Heart Study, which was conducted by Ohoo. 
The researchers pointed out that only men from the Japanese dynasty participated, so these findings do not apply to women or other people. 
Pesticides, having a long half-life, can cause harm to the body over a long period of time, affecting the health of those who are exposed to them. 
In this event, within the next 10 years, the maximum damage will be found. 
One news report quoted Dr. Robert as saying: "After following those people for 34 years, we found no correlation between the pesticides they used in their work and the heart disease and hypertension they developed."
The connection between the age-old factors and the major factors, and the possibility of a connection between the pesticides and the heart disease that occurs in later life, is not ruled out. 
Researchers have found that there is no significant correlation between the dosage of pesticides and the occurrence of heart disease or stroke. 
The Gelenski-Tramp phone call: Poroshenko's thought 
The actions to remove the office of President Donald Trump, who is opposed to the US President, have started, and as a result, this week has become a stormy one in Washington politics.
Volodymyr Selenskyi, who has little experience in politics, would want to avoid being dragged into one political scandal after another.
But as for the connection between Solzhenitsyn and Trump, what do we know about it so far, and will it have long-term effects on Solzhenitsyn?
The US has been doing more for Ukraine than any other European country, even at the beginning of the phone call, according to Trump at a press conference in Helsinki. 
Trump is saying that even though there is no word for "telephone" in the White House, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders are only talking, without any concrete plans, and that Trump is pointing this out about Merkel. 
The response of Selenskyi that 100% accepts Trump's words, but instead says 1000%, is considered problematic in the context of the issue. 
The President of France, Macron and Merkel, have not taken adequate action to help Ukraine, said Selenki.
The above conversation has been brought out to express the views of politicians, especially those in opposition parties in Ukraine, in the social media. 
The former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, has tweeted that the help provided by the European Union is "nothing new" on Twitter. 
Porošenko, in other tweets, said that during the time of the Russian occupation, the European Union provided Ukraine with restrictions and economic assistance, and that he is grateful for that. 
Ukrainian politician Viktoriya Vysotska, "How can we talk to Germany and France again?" she said, and others expressed concern in this situation. 
Trump, who secretly referred to the military aid as a "backup plan" related to Ukraine, has asked the FBI to investigate two matters, including the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's server and the hacking of emails related to the 2016 election, which he claims was done by Ukraine, and not by Russia, as previously reported.
Will the relationship with Europe be cut off or will the relationship with the Presidents of France and Germany be severed?
I do not wish to speak ill of anyone 
The UN General Assembly in New York, following the release of a telephone text message, heard Celiku say, "We thank everyone who has helped us."
The leaders of Russia, Germany, and France will meet with Selensky in the Normandy Four meeting in October. 
One who had been living peacefully, suddenly became restless, and started chasing the nearby stars. 
If a black ant becomes a nucleus of a star and shines, it will be called "Kuvasar". 
The scientists at the Palo Alto Research Center in America have observed that the light of the seven colors of the rainbow is shining. 
This is something that should have taken millions of years to happen, but it has happened in just six months, surprising scientists. 
The reason why we need to grow many trees is that they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen. 
But, "Hypertech Industries" has created, "iOS" called, "Bio Reactor" tool, which can absorb 1 acre of trees' carbon - dioxide, and absorb 10 times more carbon - dioxide than that. 
The yeast "Clostridium valgari" growing inside the reactor like a cold storage box, is absorbing carbon dioxide.

Youths should step aside from the temptations of the world. 
A wrong notion has been created that there is no danger at all because of the small number of accidents. 
The act of smoking nicotine-containing liquids in e-cigarettes, unlike ordinary cigarettes, produces a type of chemical fumes that can harm health.

We have implemented a plan to prevent 3000 MGD of treated water from being wasted into the sea from Andhra Pradesh, at a cost of 6 billion rupees. 
But despite many rounds of talks, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka failed to reach an agreement on water conservation projects.

There has been no progress so far in the Kaveri issue through talks.

The Los Angeles Police Department shut down a cannabis dispensary operating illegally in the San Gabriel Mountains 
The EL Monte (California) Police Department – On Wednesday, the police department of El Monte, California, seized an illegal marijuana grow operation in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
The police, who had received a warrant to investigate a suspected illegal sale of ganja and hash oil, found and destroyed a large quantity of hash oil and cannabis oil at around 4:37 pm at a office building located at 9600 Avenue, Telstar, – in the largest jars, butane honey oil – highly concentrated hash oil – at the office building located at 9600 Avenue, Telstar, around 4:37 pm.

He said, "This is a very dangerous process." 
According to Kano, who used to work in the petroleum industry, there is a possibility of fire breaking out in the process of refining oil for use in wood products, as he stated in the petroleum industry.
The person said, "Because it is in a state of being charged, the normal state of our clothes will cause an electric spark to ignite and trigger a fire accident." 
Even if there are many fires and similar things, if one does not follow one after another, a normal fire accident may not occur, and this multi-storey building may collapse and break into pieces in this fire accident. 
The task force that was called to seize the object that could cause chaos and lawlessness, which was lying idle in the office, has been formed.
The value of the goods and the instrument seized is not immediately known. 
The experts who investigated the information provided by the unknown person, who had gone to the place on the orders of the search warrant, said that they found illegal activities. 
The investigators are still trying to find out who is behind the illegal operation. 
The person who caused that place to be vacant was able to set up an office there because they believed that the one who caused it to be vacant could do so. 
In a state of ongoing investigation, they have stated that they will not provide any illegal substances to anyone, especially those related to the recent information about the act of vaping. 
Cano said, “It is not even known to them whether what they want is what is given to them, it is one thing that is not known to them.” 
It can be mixed with other chemicals that cause harm. 
This is a great harm to our society, to children, and so we always warn against such actions.
The first dress of Elizabeth is going to be displayed in the Hampton Court Palace. 
It was made as the most excellent sample, with the base of the copper plate being hammered and the embroidery being done with a variety of flowers, animals and butterflies, and it has been made into a very precise and detailed embroidery. 
The historic royal palaces of the royal family, which are responsible for collecting and storing the royal clothing, are saying that there is only one thing that can be said about it. 
A piece of cloth that was hung 100 years ago on the wall of a small rural church, which Elizabeth the First had seen, could now be a dress from the wardrobe of Elizabeth the First.
The altar cloth used in the church in Bedfordshire, which was worn by Tudor Queen Elizabeth, is to be displayed at the Hampton Court Palace, the next month, after being seen by chance in a room three years ago, 450 years before Queen Elizabeth wore it. 
The royal collection in its entirety consists of only one dress from the 16th century, which is of great importance in the discovery.
The documents that claim that this dress was worn by Queen Elizabeth at some point in time have no evidence to back up their claim, but even so, experts believe that this dress must have been part of the royal family's wardrobe, given the three-year research that has gone into studying the dress.
The silk cloth with the price tag of the emperor, which is very expensive and rare, is a statutory reserve for the most dignified members of the royal family. It is also a masterpiece of artistry, as it is made from the most exquisite flowers and trees, and the craftsmanship is exceptional. It is accompanied by a lion, a dog, a butterfly, a fisherman, and a tiger, all of which symbolize the high status of the previous owner. 
This sculpture was created at the time when Turner was equal in value to the great artist. 
In the later part of Elizabeth's reign, in the 1950s, the other women in the palace, who were competing with her, would not accept that she was wearing such a luxurious dress, and would not acknowledge her as their equal. 
That is a great matter, therefore many wise men came and saw it. 
When they see it, they will exclaim "Wow!" at that moment, and when they leave, they will realize that what they saw is just one of the royal family's attire, and with this thought, they will always be able to appreciate what they see, as long as they have this thought. 
The second longest life in the collection of garments, which has been cut again to be used as a vestment in the Saint Faith's Church in the crypt of the Benedictine monastery, where the darkness is enveloped, cannot be thought of as having been obtained unexpectedly. 
The Buckingham Palace, where Queen Elizabeth II has spent her long life serving, is the closest to the Queen among the many respected women who have served her, and in addition, local stories have been connected to the Queen's industry for a long time. 
The garment in question, although it dates back to 1590, when the owner passed away, could have been given to the Church of the parish or the Berry family before Elizabeth's death in 1603, as the experts believe. 
The textile that was carefully preserved for over 1000 years after being washed, and then had 400 or more hours of intricate embroidery and fine needlework done on it in a special way, using high-quality silk and fine needles, is to be displayed next to Elizabeth's famous portrait "Rainbow Portrait" after the latter, which shows her wearing a similar gown, was loaned by the Hatfield House. 
Translation: "When you work with clothes that are historically significant, the people who created them will be respected in truth," said Libby Thomas, who led the protection, as a significant part of the protection took place in the changed pavilion of the Hampton Court lawns, where the priceless curtains were hung, which was only a small part of the total space available. 
When I looked at the embryo which is in front and behind, I felt great respect for those who created it.
I have never done any work in the garment that is so rich and full of wealth. 
The dress of Elizabeth which had gone missing was put on display at the Hampton Court Palace on October 12. 
The student who cheated in the exam and was named "Uththi Surya" (meaning "Rising Sun") at Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan College of Nursing, has come to light. 
He was arrested by the police along with his family after this. 
This has been followed in all medical colleges where students' physical check-ups have been intensified. 
In this state, it was known that the old photo of Kovai PSG Medical College students Jothika and Siva Ramachandran, and the current photo, have a difference. 
The investigation was conducted under the medical college department. 
The director of the medical college in Chennai, Narayana Babu, spoke to journalists today about this matter. 
The photographs of two students are slightly different and we received a report on the 23rd date. 
We set up a 5-member investigation committee after this. 
We have investigated two students and their parents. 
We have collected and compared the documents we have with their certificates, the NIT hall ticket, and the identity card, etc.
The conclusion of this research is that both students are not identical, it is confirmed. 
Even if there is a slight difference in photographs, such a problem arises. 
As a result, from next year, students will have to follow the bio-metric attendance system during their admission process, according to the Health Minister's order. 
The following shall be implemented in the coming times: bio-metric and manual record keeping. 
The registration of students in the periods of application, selection and admission shall be done only through online mode. 
As a result, no one can commit a crime in this.
After this, the students who were under investigation, namely Sivaramachandran and Jothika, along with others, spoke to the investigators. 
In Jothika's words, I was in a state where I had given away a photo of myself, where I had a double chin and a puffy face, similar to how I looked then. 
That is a photo taken in school time. 
I have made up my mind now. 
Therefore, it is not like that now. 
They brought me along with them, saying that it is for this reason and that they would scrutinize everything. 
The one who has cut his hair is now in trouble, there is nothing else, he said with a sigh. 
According to Ramanujan, there is a difference between the form that exists now and the old photograph. 
There was only one photo of me at that time. 
That is an old photo. 
As a result, confusion arose, and an inquiry was held. 
The Prime Minister Modi has been requested by the Pandal Plastic Association to protect the livelihood of millions of workers.
The following is what Sangaran, V.K. Balu, the secretary, has stated in the news report released by them:-
In India, plastic waste collected from street bins and thrown into plastic containers is being recycled. 
All plastic products banned in some states of India are recyclable. 
The reason for this in India is that 60% to 70% of plastic waste is being recycled already, due to poverty and lack of employment. 
Waste materials that are available can be utilized in a useful manner.
1. Plastic road tar
The bags that are considered important in the society, which is known for its habit of returning the goods to the customers after they purchase the goods, are being given away for free. 
Plastic bags are floating in all water bodies. 
The plastic waste that is not plastic bottles, but other waste materials, all sink to the bottom of the water, but plastic bottles float on the surface of the water because they are less dense than water. 
The plastic bottle is floating on the water. 
There are factories that produce 40,000 plastic products all over India. 
This contains 98% small and short varieties.
There are countless shops that buy and sell plastic products similar to this. 
There are 2,000 companies that import plastic products. 
Around 50 lakh people are getting job opportunities in production and sales combined. 
The plastic industry is providing 5 crore rupees as a grant to the state governments, and also providing 50 crore rupees as an interest-free loan. 
Translation: Until the plastic industry is concerned, there is no environmental issue in its production or in using its products. 
But due to the lack of awareness about environmental health among the general public, environmental problems arise.
Translation:
They have said so in that report.

The only state that provides assistance to those who make the Hajj journey in India is Tamil Nadu, and he proudly declared it. 
The conference on Indian Hajj was held at the Hajj House in Mumbai on an all-India scale, under the auspices of the Indian Hajj Committee. 
The Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Dr. Asif, and the President of the Indian Hajj Association, Abu Bakkar, were the special invitees who attended. 
The leaders of the Hajj organization, action officials, foreign affairs department, and officials related to the welfare of minority communities participated with them.
Abu Bakr, who had been speaking in a gathering, said that the enthusiasm and love that the Tamil Nadu government has been providing a stipend for the last two years to make the Haj pilgrimage for the Muslims, is due to the love and affection they have for the Muslims. 
The only government that provides such a pension in India is Tamil Nadu alone, he said. 
The Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Asif, said that the attempt will be made to facilitate 30 lakh Haj pilgrims to undertake the Haj journey by 2025. 
Air India had problems with the Hajj pilgrims who went to Hajj in 2019.

In Mexico, the leader of the drug trafficking is the reason for one-third of the drugs in America. 
The Chicago Sun-Times reported that a group that came to the city in the morning for a party, which was supposed to be for the sake of medicine, was seen in the western part of Chicago. 
In the Drug Control Administration (DEA) of the Narcotics Bureau, Brian McNight showed what he does in the light of day. 
As a result of taking excessive amounts of intoxicating substances, almost 800 people died last year in Chicago. 
According to McNight, about 90% of the drugs in Chicago are from Mexico. 
The DEA is paying close attention to Nemesis, also known as Servatus, who is also known as Menescho. 
The first priority of the DEA and the Department of Justice in Mexico is he. 
The prize for the best engineer is $10 million. 
He has helped to discover the laboratories where tens of thousands of monkeys are used in drug testing. 
Elmenco, a person responsible for the theft of a third of the drugs that enter the United States through the sea and land, is either Jelisco Nueva Generación or Sijenchi.
According to the court's verdict, the thief, who was caught with a quantity of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, all packaged and hidden in his pants, has been arrested.
The Nobel Prize of the year has been announced, and the winner of the award is Elon Musk, and the prize money is $10 million. 
Thirty years ago, he was living in California when he was arrested on charges of drug use and was eventually deported to Mexico. 
The one who is there, started the cruel theft there. 
He has a large number of weapons, RPGs, and 50 caliber weapons. 
He has his own group of friends, who are loyal to him, and who are based on his own foundation,” said Donahue. 
The Mexican army shot down a helicopter from the moment it was shot down, killing six people, and until many people were hanged in the gallows, El Mencho, his empire remained unscathed without punishment.
The violence of the thieves has caused the death of thousands of people in recent years. 
According to the data point of the Mexican government, there are approximately 94 homicides per day. 
The Mexican drugs seized in Chicago are extremely dangerous, and it is not possible to handle them without protective gear.
In the court of trial, the fingerprints of thieves are recorded. 
It is possible to see the seal of Menchu's wisdom in the one part of three that is excessive. 
Donahue says, “The father who causes the death of his daughters and sons in reality is the one who sends the venomous arrow for the destruction of his daughters and sons, that is to say, the one who causes the death of his daughters and sons is the one who sends the venomous arrow for the destruction of his daughters and sons.” 
So, whoever's child dies, the medicines that came from Menchov's organization are said to have a "higher chance" of being effective, according to Donahue. 
In the previous year, more than 67,000 Americans died due to excessive consumption of intoxicating drugs. 
Those who do not take pride in calling Modi the father of India should not call themselves Indians, said Union Minister Jitendra Singh.
The BJP leaders are continuously portraying Gandhiji and Nehru in a wrong manner, and everyone knows this. 
The middle minister Amit Shah has said that before the Houston event, which was called "Howdy Modi", that the occupation of Kashmir by Pakistan was the reason for the creation of Kashmir, in America where Houston is located. 
The day before yesterday, many BJP leaders including Prakya Thakur, used to criticize Gandhi and praise the RSS.
The event "Howdy Modi" held in Houston city, Prime Minister Modi announced that he will again support Trump, the US President, as President.
The American President Trump has highly praised Modi instead of this. 
The speaker mentioned that in his speech, there were deep divisions in the country, and he, as the father of the nation, removed those divisions and brought unity. 
When it was said that Gandhi was the father of India, it caused surprise to many. 
The senior leader of the Congress, Ananth Kumar, said that Prime Minister Modi has used his drumbeat to promote the event of the Modi government's "Howdy Modi" event, which was attended by him. 
This is a very wrong action. 
Mahatma Gandhi has said that it is wrong to call him the father of India, since he has put himself forward as the father of India in place of India's real father, that is, the country itself. 
The middle-ranking Minister Jitendra Singh said, "The American President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the father of India." 
Some people have expressed opposition to this. 
The statement that those who do not take pride in calling the Prime Minister Modi as the father of India cannot call themselves Indians has sparked a controversy.

The Sri Lankan government has welcomed the proposal to return the Maldives to the general public. 
This is in relation to the press release issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India on the following topic: 
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ariyasinghe, welcomed the proposal to re-admit Maldives to the United Nations on a public interest basis. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ravinatha Aryasinha, on the 28th of last month, announced that Sri Lanka has decided to re-apply for membership to the Commonwealth, after a 40-year hiatus, in order to participate fully in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2020, which will be held in Rwanda. He also stated that Sri Lanka will follow the same fast-track procedure that was used earlier to re-apply for membership to the Commonwealth, and that the government has decided to support the country's full membership in the Commonwealth once again. 
One of the events held during the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the High Representative for the United Nations, Mr. António Guterres, on September 26, 2019, in New York, was the meeting of the foreign ministers of the international community, which was attended by Mr. Ahmed, the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom, as the Chairman. 
The President Ariyasinha said that Sri Lanka, which is a close neighbor and a country in the South Asian region, has been experiencing strong and multi-faceted relations with the Maldives, and that in the past year, the Maldives' new government has taken significant initiatives, including rejoining the Commonwealth, and that this is a joyful and gratifying thing for Sri Lanka. 
The Foreign Minister has pointed out that the comprehensive assessment carried out by the Secretariat in January 2019 in Malé, which led to a negative decision, should be seen as mere criticisms, which affect all countries, rather than any obstacles to the country's re-entry.
The excessive encouragement of mediocre endeavors shall not lead to additional obstacles being placed on their path, and this was emphasized by him. 
On September 27, 2019, a meeting of the 77th (G77) Group of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the United Nations held in New York. 
The G77 is a unique entity that has been established to address the diverse needs of countries with special situations, including landlocked countries, developed countries surrounded by land, and small island developing states, in the context of global actions for the implementation of the various needs of these countries.
The problems of this era are causing economic and social development to decline, and are also damaging the abilities of those who are striving to achieve sustainable development goals. 
The organization should work as a united voice calling for a significant amount of international assistance and support, particularly in terms of finance and capacity building, for the countries that are vulnerable and landlocked, especially in terms of finance and capacity building.

Ronald Lee Haskell: The person who killed his former wife's family in Texas was punished 
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, in the spring of 2014, along with his wife Stephen and Kethi, and their five children, four of whom he killed. 
On July 9, 2019, after separating from his wife Melanie Haskel, he went into his stay-in wife's house to find out where she was. 
There was no one there, but his sister Kate's stay and his family were present. 
The police in Harris County Sheriff's Office have reported that when Haskell was shot with a rifle, Stephen Stay, 39, and his wife, Stay, 33, and their two children, 13 and 4 years old, and two girls, 9 and 7 years old, were killed. 
The only one who survived from that family was a 15-year-old CD student. 
Even after he had fully recovered after a short while, the authorities recorded that he had been injured. 
Ronald Leslie Haskell was said to have been born with a silver spoon, but the judges rejected the claim as unfounded and baseless. 
The court was adjourned until the next day for punishment. 
Quantum internet is approaching reality – Scientific newspaper
The conclusion of an American military research has brought the quantum internet one step closer. 
The corresponding system, which is not possible in conventional networks, provides protection, detection, and real-time processing capabilities to the military.
The Quantum Information Science and Technology (QUINST) center, a research facility that has been funded by the military research agency and managed by the military research office, has developed a technology that uses fiber optic cables to transmit quantum information over a distance of 50 kilometers, between matter and light. 
The phrase "பின்னல்" (pinnal) means a connection or link between quantum particles, such as electrons, similar to the connection between atoms, forming a bond.
The connection between the two cubes has been established, and if one is measured, the result of measuring the other will also be affected, even if it is at a great distance from the other cube.
The process will be a quantum network spanning over 50 kilometers, which is farther than what was previously thought possible. The researcher, who is also the lead researcher for this project, is a professor at the University of Innsbruck and has published his findings in the journal Nature Quantum Information. 
The quantum networks between cities are formed by the edges of the geometric cubes, even if they are placed at a very great distance, they will be stable.
Researchers say that this network cannot be established without this distribution. 
The Deputy Director of the military project, Sarah Campbell, stated that this research will be a key step in realizing the potential of the large-scale logistics system, which has been put into action.
The fiber optic path after traveling through it, the quality of the return signal is extremely high and can fulfill the requirements of some quantum communication applications.
The research team started an experiment using a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap, which is a device that uses electromagnetic fields to confine and manipulate individual atoms or subatomic particles. 
Researchers used laser beams to create a quantum state on an ion, and at the same time, they induced a proton to emit a quantum information. 
As a result, the quantum states of the atomic nucleus and photon particles became entangled. 
The challenge lies in sending photons through fiber optic cables. 
Lanyan said that the wavelength of the photon emitted by calcium ions is 854 nanometers, which is quickly absorbed by an optical fiber.
Therefore, his companions were sent through the crystal clear channel of a laser beam, which was as powerful as a mighty river, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were sent through the clear glass of a lantern, and it was as if they were
The signal strength of the opponent has changed to be suitable for a long-distance journey – the current standard for wireless communication is 1550 nanometers. 
After that, the researchers sent this data via a 50-kilometer-long fiber optic cable.

The high-tech "smart" clock can be paired with the Cupid app to track calcium levels, which allows for the selection of calcium usage for a long distance, and the possibility of achieving a direct path to the network infrastructure of the smart clock, which is provided by the conclusions.
The military requires very much the networks of GPS, precise location, guidance and time usage, which are already established on a large scale, for its operations,” said Dr. Frederick Fademi, a military researcher and assistant director of this project.
